.TH ATEXIT 3  2003-11-01 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
atexit \- register a function to be called at normal program termination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "int atexit(void (*" function )(void));
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBatexit()\fP function registers the given \fIfunction\fP to be
called at normal program termination, either via
.BR exit (3)
or via return from the program's \fBmain\fP().
Functions so registered are called in
the reverse order of their registration; no arguments are passed.
.LP
At least ATEXIT_MAX functions can be registered. This value
is at least 32. It can be obtained using
.BR sysconf (3).
.LP
By a successful call to one of the exec functions,
all registrations are undone.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBatexit()\fP function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
it returns a nonzero value.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void bye(void) {
        printf("That was all, folks\en");
}

int main(){
        long a;
        int i;

        a = sysconf(_SC_ATEXIT_MAX);
        printf("ATEXIT_MAX = %ld\en", a);

        i = atexit(bye);
        if (i != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "cannot set exit function\en");
                return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
