.TH DAEMON 3 1993-06-09 "BSD MANPAGE" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
daemon \- run in the background
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int daemon(int " nochdir ", int " noclose );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR daemon ()
function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from the
controlling terminal and run in the background as system daemons.
.PP
Unless the argument
.I nochdir
is non-zero,
.BR daemon ()
changes the current working directory to the root ("/").
.PP
Unless the argument
.I noclose
is non-zero,
.BR daemon ()
will redirect standard input, standard output and standard error
to \fI/dev/null\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
(This function forks, and if the
.B fork()
succeeds, the parent does
.\" not .IR in order not to underline _
.BR _exit (0),
so that further errors are seen by the child only.)
On success zero will be returned.
If an error occurs,
.BR daemon ()
returns \-1 and sets the global variable
.I errno
to any of the errors specified for the library functions
.BR fork (2)
and 
.BR setsid (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fork (2),
.BR setsid (2)
.SH NOTES
The glibc implementation can also return \-1 when
.I /dev/null
exists but is not a character device with the expected
major and minor numbers. In this case
.I errno
need not be set.
.SH HISTORY
The
.BR daemon ()
function first appeared in BSD4.4.
