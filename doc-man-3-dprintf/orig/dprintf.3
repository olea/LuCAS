.TH DPRINTF 3 2001-12-18 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
dprintf, vdprintf \- print to a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int dprintf(int " fd ", const char *" format ", ...);"
.sp
.BI "int vdprintf(int " fd ", const char *" format ", va_list " ap );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions
.B dprintf
and
.B vdprintf
(as found in the glibc2 library) are exact analogues of
.B fprintf
and
.BR vfprintf ,
except that they output to a file descriptor
.I fd
instead of to a given stream.
.SH NOTES
These functions are GNU extensions, not in C or POSIX.
Clearly, the names were badly chosen.
Many systems (like MacOS) have incompatible functions called
.IR dprintf ,
usually some debugging version of
.IR printf ,
perhaps with a prototype like

.BI "void dprintf (int level, const char *" format ", ...);"

where the first parameter is a debugging level (and output is to
.IR stderr ).
Moreover,
.B dprintf
(or
.BR DPRINTF )
is also a popular macro name for a debugging printf.
So, probably, it is better to avoid this function in programs
intended to be portable.

A better name would have been
.IR fdprintf .
