If a query string contains multiple <SPAN

commands can be obtained individually.  (This allows a simple form of
overlapped processing, by the way: the frontend can be handling the
results of one query while the backend is still working on later
queries in the same query string.)  However, calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</TT

still cause the frontend to block until the backend completes the
next <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

functions:

but returns 0 if there was some kind of trouble (in which case
<TT

CLASS="FUNCTION"

prepared to deal with a result or notification just yet.  The
routine will read available data and save it in a buffer, thereby
causing a <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>select</TT

application can thus use <TT

	  Obtain the file descriptor number for the backend connection socket.

<PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"

other conditions.
If the result of <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>select</TT

the backend socket, then <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

has returned 0 indicating that there is no buffered data waiting to be sent
to the backend.</P
></LI
></UL

><P
>A typical frontend using these functions will have a main loop that uses
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>select</TT

respond to.  One of the conditions will be input available from the backend,
which in <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>select</TT
>'s terms is readable data on the file
descriptor identified by <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQsocket</TT
>.
When the main loop detects input ready, it should call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQconsumeInput</TT

<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQisBusy</TT
>, followed by <TT

><P
>A frontend that uses <TT

	  Request that <SPAN

	  processing of the current query.
<PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
>int PQrequestCancel(PGconn *conn);</PRE
>
The return value is 1 if the cancel request was successfully
dispatched, 0 if not.  (If not, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQerrorMessage</TT
> tells why not.)
Successful dispatch is no guarantee that the request will have any
effect, however.  Regardless of the return value of <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQrequestCancel</TT
>,
the application must continue with the normal result-reading
sequence using <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</TT
>.  If the cancellation
is effective, the current query will terminate early and return
an error result.  If the cancellation fails (say, because the
backend was already done processing the query), then there will
be no visible result at all.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Note that if the current query is part of a transaction, cancellation
will abort the whole transaction.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQrequestCancel</TT
> can safely be invoked from a signal handler.
So, it is also possible to use it in conjunction with plain
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</TT
>, if the decision to cancel can be made in a signal
handler.  For example, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> invokes
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQrequestCancel</TT
> from a SIGINT signal handler, thus allowing
interactive cancellation of queries that it issues through <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</TT
>.
Note that <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQrequestCancel</TT
> will have no effect if the connection
is not currently open or the backend is not currently processing a query.</P
