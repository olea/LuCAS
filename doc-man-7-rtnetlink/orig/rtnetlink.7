.SH NAME
rtnetlink, NETLINK_ROUTE \- Linux IPv4 routing socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <asm/types.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/netlink.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/rtnetlink.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/socket.h>

.BI "rtnetlink_socket = socket(PF_NETLINK, int " socket_type ", NETLINK_ROUTE);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Rtnetlink allows the kernel's routing tables to be read and altered.  
It is used within the kernel to communicate between
various subsystems, though this usage is not documented here, and for 
communication with user-space programs.
Network routes, ip addresses, link parameters, neighbour setups, queueing
disciplines, traffic classes and packet classifiers may all be controlled
through
.B NETLINK_ROUTE
sockets.  It is based on netlink messages, see 
.BR netlink (7)
for more information. 

.\" XXX: all these macros could be moved to rtnetlink(3) 

.SH "ROUTING ATTRIBUTES"
Some rtnetlink messages have optional attributes after the initial header:

.nf
.ta 4 19 32
struct rtattr
{
	unsigned short	rta_len;	/* Length of option */
	unsigned short	rta_type;	/* Type of option */
	/* Data follows */ 
};
.fi

These attributes should be only manipulated using the RTA_* macros or libnetlink,
see
.BR rtnetlink (3).

.SH MESSAGES
Rtnetlink consists of these message types
(in addition to standard netlink messages):
.TP
.BR RTM_NEWLINK ", " RTM_DELLINK ", " RTM_GETLINK
Create, remove or get information about a specific network interface. 
These messages contain an
.B ifinfomsg
structure followed by a series of
.B rtattr
structures.

.nf
.ta 4 19 32
struct ifinfomsg
{
	unsigned char	ifi_family;	/* AF_UNSPEC */
	unsigned short	ifi_type;	/* Device type */ 
	int	ifi_index;		/* Interface index   */
	unsigned int	ifi_flags;	/* Device flags  */
	unsigned int	ifi_change;	/* change mask */
};
.fi

.\" XXX ifi_type
.B ifi_flags 
contains the device flags, see
.BR netdevice(7);
.B ifi_index
is the unique interface index,
.B ifi_change
is reserved for future use and should be always set to 0xFFFFFFFF.

Add, remove or receive information about an IP address associated with 
an interface. In Linux 2.2 an interface can carry multiple IP addresses,
this replaces the alias device concept in 2.0. In Linux 2.2 these messages
support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. They contain an
.B ifaddrmsg
structure, optionally followed by
.B rtaddr
routing attributes.

.nf
.ta 4 19 32
struct ifaddrmsg
{
	unsigned char	ifa_family;	/* Address type */
	unsigned char	ifa_prefixlen;	/* Prefixlength of the address */
	unsigned char	ifa_flags;	/* Address flags */
	unsigned char	ifa_scope;	/* Address scope */
	int	ifa_index;		/* Interface index   */
};
.fi

.B ifa_family
is the address family type (currently 
.B AF_INET
or
.B AF_INET6), 
.B ifa_prefixlen
is the length of the address mask of the address if defined for the 
family (like for IPv4), 
.B ifa_scope
is the address scope,
.B ifa_index
is the interface index of the interface the address is associated with.   
.B ifa_flags
is a flag word of
.B IFA_F_SECONDARY
for secondary address (old alias interface), 
.B IFA_F_PERMANENT
for a permanent address set by the user and other undocumented flags.

Create, remove or receive information about a network route.
These messages contain an

structure with an optional sequence of 
.B rtattr
structures following. For
.B RTM_GETROUTE
setting 
.B rtm_dst_len 
and 
.B rtm_src_len 
to 0 means you get all entries for the specified routing table.
For the other fields except 
.B rtm_table 
and 
.B rtm_protocol
0 is the wildcard.
