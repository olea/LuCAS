.TH UPDWTMP 3  2003-07-18 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
updwtmp, logwtmp \- append an entry to the wtmp file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <utmp.h>
.sp
.BI "void updwtmp(const char *" wtmp_file ", const struct utmp *" ut );
.br
.BI "void logwtmp(const char *" line ", const char *" name ", const char *" host );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBupdwtmp\fR() appends the utmp structure
.I ut
to the wtmp file.
.PP
\fBlogwtmp\fR() constructs an utmp structure using
.IR line ", " name ", " host ,
current time and current process id.
Then it calls \fBupdwtmp\fR() to append the structure to the utmp file.
.SH AVAILABILITY
Both functions are available under glibc2, but not under libc5.
However,
.B logwtmp
used to occur in the old libbsd. These days, the
.B logwtmp
function is included in libutil. (Hence you'll need to add
.B \-lutil
to your compiler commandline to get it.)
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/log/wtmp
database of past user logins
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR wtmp (5)
