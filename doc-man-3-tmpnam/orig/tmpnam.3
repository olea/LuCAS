.TH TMPNAM 3  2003-11-15 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
tmpnam, tmpnam_r \- create a name for a temporary file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "char *tmpnam(char *" s );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tmpnam()
function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid filename,
and such that a file with this name did not exist at some point
in time, so that naive programmers may think it
a suitable name for a temporary file. If the argument
.I s
is NULL this name is generated in an internal static buffer
and may be overwritten by the next call to
.BR tmpnam() .
If
.I s
is not NULL, the name is copied to the character array (of length
at least
.IR L_tmpnam )
pointed to by
.I s
and the value
.I s
is returned in case of success.
.LP
The path name that is created, has a directory prefix
.IR P_tmpdir .
(Both
.I L_tmpnam
and
.I P_tmpdir
are defined in
.IR <stdio.h> ,
just like the TMP_MAX mentioned below.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.B tmpnam()
function returns a pointer to a unique temporary 
filename, or NULL if a unique name cannot be generated.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.SH NOTES
The
.B tmpnam()
function generates a different string each time it is called,
up to TMP_MAX times. If it is called more than TMP_MAX times,
the behaviour is implementation defined.
.LP
Portable applications that use threads cannot call
.B tmpnam()
with NULL parameter if either _POSIX_THREADS or
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is defined.
.LP
A POSIX draft proposed to use a function
.B tmpnam_r()
defined by
.sp
.nf
.in +5
char *tmpnam_r(char *s) {
    return s ? tmpnam(s) : NULL;
}
.in
.fi
.sp
apparently as a warning not to use NULL.
A few systems implement it. To get a glibc prototype,
define _SVID_SOURCE or _BSD_SOURCE before including
.IR "<stdio.h>" .
.SH BUGS
Never use this function. Use
.BR mkstemp (3)
instead.
