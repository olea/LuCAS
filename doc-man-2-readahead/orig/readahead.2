.TH READAHEAD 2 2004-10-05 "Linux 2.6.5" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
readahead \- perform file readahead into page cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fcntl.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t readahead(int " fd ", off64_t *" offset ", size_t " count );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B readahead()
populates the page cache with data from a file so that subsequent
reads from that file will not block on disk I/O.
The
.I fd
argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which is
to be read.
The
.I offset
argument specifies the starting point from which data is to be read
and
.I count
specifies the number of bytes to be read.
I/O is performed in whole pages, so that 
.I offset
is effectively rounded down to a page boundary
and bytes are read up to the next page boundary greater than or
equal to
.IR "(offset+count)" .
.B readahead()
does not read beyond the end of the file.
.B readahead()
blocks until the specified data has been read.
The current file offset of the open file referred to by
.I fd
is left unchanged.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, 
.B readahead()
returns 0; on failure, \-1 is returned, with
.I errno
set to indicate the cause of the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I fd
does not refer to a file type to which
.B readahead
can be applied.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The 
.B readahead()
system call is Linux specific, and its use should be avoided
in portable applications.
.SH NOTES
The
.B readahead()
system call appeared in Linux 2.4.13.
