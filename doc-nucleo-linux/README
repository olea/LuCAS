This is work in progress.  At the Linux Kongress in Berlin I was asked
about the possibility of a book about Linux and I foolishly agreed to
think about it.  This latex/xfig source tree is the result of that 
thinking.   There are a few things to note:

(1) This is GNU copyleft'd work that I intend "donating" to the Linux
Documentation Project (it may also be published seperately),

(2) This is not the Kernel Hacker's Guide.  It is intended to be 
read (and understood) by people who use Linux and would like to 
understand how the operating system works.   A good example would be
someone who can set up a swap file but doesn't understand how Linux
swaps (read chapter 3),

(3) It is not a Linux Internals document.   I've tried to make it
pretty generic, although the data structure definitions are perhaps
less generic than I like.

(4) The name ("The Linux Kernel") is a working title only, maybe I lack
imagination but I can't yet think of what it should be called.
