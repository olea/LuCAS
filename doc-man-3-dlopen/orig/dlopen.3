.SH NAME
dladdr, dlclose, dlerror, dlopen, dlsym, dlvsym \- programming interface to
dynamic linking loader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dlfcn.h>
.sp
.BI "void *dlopen(const char *" filename ", int " flag );
.sp
.BI "char *dlerror(void);"
.sp
.BI "void *dlsym(void *" handle ", const char *" symbol );
.sp
.BI "int dlclose(void *" handle );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The four functions
.BR dlopen() ,
.BR dlsym() ,
.BR dlclose() ,
.BR dlerror()
implement the interface to the dynamic linking loader.
.SS "dlerror"
The function
.B dlerror()
returns a human readable string describing the most recent error
that occurred from any of the dl routines (dlopen, dlsym or dlclose)
since the last call to
.BR dlerror() .
It returns NULL if no errors have occurred since initialization or since
it was last called.
.SS "dlopen"
The function
.B dlopen()
loads the dynamic library file named by the null-terminated
string
.I filename
and returns an opaque "handle" for the dynamic library.
If
.I filename
is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program.
If
.I filename
contains a slash ("/"), then it is interpreted as a (relative
or absolute) pathname.
Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches for the library as follows
(see
.BR ld.so (8)
for further details):
.IP o
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program
contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag,
then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH tag are searched.
.IP o
If the environment variable
.BR LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is defined to contain a colon-separated list of directories,
then these are searched.
(As a security measure this variable is ignored for set-UID and 
set-GID programs.)
.IP o
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program
contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in that tag
are searched.
.IP o
The cache file
.BR /etc/ld.so.cache
(maintained by
.BR ldconfig (8))
is checked to see whether it contains an entry for
.IR filename .
.IP o
The directories
.B /lib 
and 
.B /usr/lib 
are searched (in that order).
.PP
If the library has dependencies on other shared libraries,
then these are also automatically loaded by the dynamic linker
using the same rules.  (This process may occur recursively,
if those libraries in turn have dependencies, and so on.)
.PP
The value of
.I flag
can be either
.B RTLD_LAZY
or
.BR RTLD_NOW .
When
.B RTLD_NOW
is specified, or the environment variable
.B LD_BIND_NOW
is set to a non-empty string,
all undefined symbols in the library are resolved before
.B dlopen()
returns. If this cannot be done, an error is returned.
Otherwise binding is lazy: symbol values are first resolved
when needed.
.PP
Optionally,
.B RTLD_GLOBAL
may be or'ed into
.IR flag ,
in which case the external symbols defined in the library will be
made available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded libraries.
(The converse of
.B RTLD_GLOBAL
is
.BR RTLD_LOCAL .
.\" that indicates that the symbols in this library should not be made
.\" available for resolution of symbols of subsequently loaded libraries.
This is the default.)
.PP
If
.I filename
is a NULL pointer, then the returned handle is for the main program.
When given to
.BR dlsym() ,
this handle causes a search for a symbol in the main program,
followed by all shared libraries loaded at program startup,
and then all shared libraries loaded by 
.BR dlopen()
with the flag
.B RTLD_GLOBAL.
.PP
External references in the library are resolved using the libraries
in that library's dependency list and any other libraries previously
opened with the 
.B RTLD_GLOBAL
flag.
If the executable was linked with the flag "-rdynamic"
(or, synonymously, "--export-dynamic"),
then the global symbols in the executable will also be used
to resolve references in a dynamically loaded library.
.PP
If the same library is loaded again with
.BR dlopen() ,
the same file handle is returned. The dl library maintains reference
counts for library handles, so a dynamic library is not
deallocated until
.B dlclose()
has been called on it as many times as
.B dlopen()
has succeeded on it. The
.B _init
routine, if present, is only called once. But a subsequent call with
.B RTLD_NOW
may force symbol resolution for a library earlier loaded with
.BR RTLD_LAZY .
.PP
If
.B dlopen()
fails for any reason, it returns NULL.
.SS "dlsym"
The function
.B dlsym()
takes a "handle" of a dynamic library returned by dlopen and the
NUL-terminated symbol name, returning the address where that symbol is
loaded into memory.  If the symbol is not found, in the specified
library or any of the libraries that were automatically loaded by
.B dlopen()
when that library was loaded,
.B dlsym()
returns NULL.
(The search performed by
.B dlsym()
is breadth first through the dependency tree of these libraries.)
Since the value of the symbol could actually be NULL (so that a
NULL return from
.B dlsym()
need not indicate an error), the correct way to test for an error
is to call
.B dlerror()
to clear any old error conditions, then call
.BR dlsym() ,
and then call
.B dlerror()
again, saving its return value into a variable, and check whether
this saved value is not NULL.
.PP
There are two special pseudo-handles,
.B RTLD_DEFAULT
and
.BR RTLD_NEXT .
The former will find the first occurrence of the desired symbol
using the default library search order. The latter
will find the next occurrence of a function in the search order
after the current library.  This allows one to provide a wrapper
around a function in another shared library.
.SS "dlclose"
The function
.B dlclose()
decrements the reference count on the dynamic library handle
.IR handle .
If the reference count drops to zero and no other loaded libraries use
symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded.
.LP
The function
.B dlclose()
returns 0 on success, and non-zero on error.
.SS "The obsolete symbols _init and _fini"
The linker recognizes special symbols
.B _init
and
.BR _fini .
If a dynamic library exports a routine named
.BR _init ,
then that code is executed after the loading, before
.B dlopen()
returns. If the dynamic library exports a routine named
.BR _fini ,
then that routine is called just before the library is unloaded.
In case you  need to  avoid  linking against the system startup files,
this can be done by giving gcc the "-nostartfiles" parameter on
the command line.
.LP
Using these routines, or the gcc
.B \-nostartupfiles
or
.B \-nostdlib
options, is not recommended. Their use may result in undesired behavior,
since the constructor/destructor routines will not be executed
(unless special measures are taken).
.\" void _init(void) __attribute__((constructor));
.\" void _fini(void) __attribute__((destructor));
.LP
Instead, libraries should export routines using the
.BR __attribute__((constructor))
and
.BR __attribute__((destructor))
function attributes.  See the gcc info pages for information on these.
Constructor routines are executed before
.B dlopen
returns, and destructor routines are executed before
.B dlclose
returns.
.SH "GNU EXTENSIONS"
Glibc adds two functions not described by POSIX, with prototypes
.sp
.nf
.B #define GNU_SOURCE
.B #include <dlfcn.h>
.sp
.BI "int dladdr(void *" addr ", Dl_info *" info );
.sp
.BI "void *dlvsym(void *" handle ", char *" symbol ", char *" version );
.fi
.PP
The function
.B dladdr()
takes a function pointer and tries to resolve name
and file where it is located. Information is stored in the
Dl_info structure:
.sp
.nf
typedef struct {
  const char *dli_fname;/* File name of defining object */
  void *dli_fbase;      /* Load address of that object */
  const char *dli_sname;/* Name of nearest lower symbol */
  void *dli_saddr;      /* Exact value of nearest symbol */
} Dl_info;
.fi
.sp
.B dladdr()
returns 0 on error, and non-zero on success.
.PP
The function
.B dlvsym()
does the same as
.B dlsym()
but takes a version string as additional argument.

.SH EXAMPLE
.B Load the math library, and print the cosine of 2.0:
.RS
.nf
.if t .ft CW
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    void *handle;
    double (*cosine)(double);
    char *error;

    handle = dlopen ("libm.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf (stderr, "%s\en", dlerror());
        exit(1);
    }

    dlerror();    /* Clear any existing error */
.\" This is the (somewhat ugly) SUSv3 TC1 fix for
.\" the dlsym() typecasting problem
    *(void **) (&cosine) = dlsym(handle, "cos");
    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL)  {
        fprintf (stderr, "%s\en", error);
        exit(1);
    }

    printf ("%f\en", (*cosine)(2.0));
    dlclose(handle);
    return 0;
}
.if t .ft P
.fi
.RE
.PP
If this program were in a file named "foo.c", you would build the program
with the following command:
.RS
.LP
gcc -rdynamic -o foo foo.c -ldl
.RE
.PP
Libraries exporting _init() and _fini() will want to be compiled as
follows, using bar.c as the example name:
.RS
.LP
gcc -shared -nostartfiles -o bar bar.c
.RE
.SH NOTES
The symbols RTLD_DEFAULT and RTLD_NEXT are defined by
.I <dlfcn.h>
only when _GNU_SOURCE was defined before including it.
.\" .LP
.\" The string returned by
.\" .B dlerror()
.\" should not be modified. Some systems give the prototype as
.\" .sp
.\" .in +5
.\" .B "const char *dlerror(void);"
.\" .in
.SH HISTORY
The dlopen interface standard comes from SunOS. That system also has
dladdr, but not dlvsym.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX 1003.1-2003 describes dlclose, dlerror, dlopen, dlsym.
