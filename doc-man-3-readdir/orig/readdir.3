.SH NAME
readdir \- read a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.sp
.B #include <dirent.h>
.sp
.BI "struct dirent *readdir(DIR *" dir );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBreaddir()\fP function returns a pointer to a dirent structure
representing the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed
to by \fIdir\fP.  It returns NULL on reaching the end-of-file or if
an error occurred.
.PP
According to POSIX, the
.I dirent
structure contains a field
.I "char d_name[]"
of unspecified size, with at most
.B NAME_MAX
characters preceding the terminating null character.
Use of other fields will harm the portability of your programs.
POSIX 1003.1-2001 also documents the field
.I "ino_t d_ino"
as an XSI extension.
.PP
The data returned by \fBreaddir()\fP may be overwritten by subsequent
calls to \fBreaddir()\fP for the same directory stream.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBreaddir()\fP function returns a pointer to a dirent structure, or
NULL if an error occurs or end-of-file is reached.
On error,
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
Invalid directory stream descriptor \fIdir\fP.
