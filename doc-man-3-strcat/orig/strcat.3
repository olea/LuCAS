.SH NAME
strcat, strncat \- concatenate two strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strcat(char *" dest ", const char *" src );
.sp
.BI "char *strncat(char *" dest ", const char *" src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrcat()\fP function appends the \fIsrc\fP string to the 
\fIdest\fP string overwriting the `\\0' character at the end of 
\fIdest\fP, and then adds a terminating `\\0' character.  The 
strings may not overlap, and the \fIdest\fP string must have
enough space for the result.
.PP
The \fBstrncat()\fP function is similar, except that it will use
at most \fIn\fP characters from \fIsrc\fP.
Since the result is always terminated with `\\0', at most \fIn\fP+1
characters are written.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrcat()\fP and \fBstrncat()\fP functions return a pointer
to the resulting string \fIdest\fP.
