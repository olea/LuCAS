.SH NAME
on_exit \- register a function to be called at normal program termination
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "int on_exit(void (*" function ")(int , void *), void *" arg );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBon_exit()\fP function registers the given \fIfunction\fP to be
called at normal program termination, whether via
.BR exit (3)
or via return from the program's \fBmain\fP.
The \fIfunction\fP is passed the argument to
.BR exit (3)
and the \fIarg\fP argument from \fBon_exit()\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBon_exit()\fP function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
it returns a non-zero value.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function comes from SunOS 4, but is also present in
libc4, libc5 and glibc. It no longer occurs in Solaris (SunOS 5).
Avoid this function, and use the standard
.BR atexit (3)
instead.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR atexit (3),
