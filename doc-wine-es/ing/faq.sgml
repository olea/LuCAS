      <question id="What-is-Wine-and-what-is-it-supposed-to">
        <para>What is Wine and what is it supposed to do ?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          Wine is a program which allows the operation of DOS and MS
          Windows programs (Windows 3.x and Win32 executables) on UNIX. 
          It consists of a program loader, which loads and executes a Windows
          binary, and a library that implements Windows API calls using
          their UNIX or X11 equivalents. The library may also be used 
          for porting Win32 code into native UNIX executables, often
          without many changes in the source. Wine is free software, 
          and its license (contained in the file LICENSE
          in each distribution) is LGPL style.

      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          Yes, there are. You can use VMWare to run a Windows installation
          inside a virtual machine, or use Win4Lin to run a specially 
          adapted Windows version on Linux. Both solutions cost money for 
          both the software itself and a Windows license.
       </para>
       <para>
         Note that, like Wine, they can only use the hardware platform that
         the target programs were originally compiled for (see below).

      <question id="Difference-between-Wine-and-emulators">
        <para>What is the difference between Wine and x86 hardware emulators?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          There are two free x86 hardware emulators:
          <ulink url="http://bochs.sourceforge.net"> bochs</ulink>, and 
          <ulink url="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/plex86"> plex86</ulink>.
       </para>

       <para>
          Plex86 is the opensource free-software alternative for VMWare,
	  VirtualPC, and other IA-32 on IA-32 "Virtual PC products." It
          can only run on the IA-32 architecture.
       </para>

       <para>
          Bochs is a highly portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator 
          written in C++, that runs on most popular platforms. It includes emulation
          of the Intel x86 CPU, common I/O devices, and a custom BIOS. Currently, 
          bochs can be compiled to emulate a 386, 486 or Pentium CPU. Bochs is capable 
          of running most Operating Systems inside the emulation including Linux, 
          Windows® 95, DOS, and recently Windows® NT 4.
       </para>

       <para>
          Both are licensed under the GPL. Bochs is older than plex86, seems to be 
          easier to install, but plex86 will run faster because plex86 uses a real 
          time binary compiler. The drawback of all emulators is that you need a version 
          of Windows in order to run Windows.

      <question id="Why-would-anyone-want-Wine-Windows-suck">
        <para>Why would anyone want Wine? Doesn't Windows suck?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          First Wine is not about running Windows but about running Windows 
          applications.
        </para>
        <para>
          So if all your computing needs are fulfilled by native Unix 
          applications, then you do not need Wine and should not be using
          it. However, if you depend on one or more of the tens of 
          thousands of Windows applications, then Wine is the best way to
          use it without giving up on Unix. Let's look at the alternatives
          to see why:
        </para>
        <para>
          The most obvious alternative is to dual-boot. This is the solution
          that provides the best compatibility. However it requires that you
          acquire a Windows license and then dedicate a good chunk of your 
          hard-drive to Windows. But the worst is yet to come. Each time you
          will want to use that application you will have to reboot to 
          Windows. This is especially significant if external factors dictate
          when you must use this application (e.g. credit card to process, 
          email to retrieve from a Lotus Notes server). Then you will find
          yourself forced to close all your Linux applications just to run
          that one Windows application. You may quickly get tired of this, or
          will find that such a situation is impossible to justify in a 
          business environment.
        </para>
        <para>
          The next solution is to install virtual machine emulation software
          such as VMWare, Win4Lin or Plex86. Then you can use windows 
          applications without suffering such a big disruption. But it still
          requires that you acquire a Windows license and dedicate as much 
          disk space to Windows. Furthermore you will pay for the added 
          convenience: if using VMWare or Win4Lin you have to buy another 
          license, and more importantly you now have to dedicate a good chunk
          of your computer's memory to the virtual machine. Performance will
          take a significant hit too.
        </para>
        <para>
          Using Wine lets you avoid all of that overhead: Windows license,
          hard-drive space required by Windows, memory and performance hit 
          taken by emulated virtual machines. Now you can start your Windows
          application straight from your regular desktop environment, place
          that application's window side by side with native application 
          windows, copy/paste from one to the other, and run it all at full speed.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is also a pretty vital part of migrating a large organisation,
          you can't change a 5000 desktop setup overnight without a lot of risk.

      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          The Wine project started in 1993 as a way to support running Windows 3.1
          programs on Linux. Bob Amstadt was the original coordinator, but turned
          it over fairly early on to Alexandre Julliard, who has run it ever 
          since. A <ulink url="news:comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine">newsgroup</ulink>
          was created in July 1994. Over the years, ports for
          other Unixes have been added, along with support for Win32 as Win32 
          applications became popular.

        <para>
          A new version of Wine is distributed about every month. You will be 
          able to keep up on all the latest releases by reading the newsgroup
          <ulink url="news:comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine">
          comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine</ulink>, or by visiting the
          <ulink url="http://www.winehq.com">Wine HQ homepage</ulink>. When
          downloading Wine from your FTP site of choice (see
          <ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/download.shtml">the Download page</ulink>
          for some of these choices), you can make sure that you are getting 
          the latest version by watching the version numbers in the distribution
          filename. For instance, the distribution released on October 31, 2002
          was called Wine-20021031.tar.gz. Patch files are also available. If
          you are current to the previous version, you can download and apply 
          just the current patch file rather than the entire new distribution.
          The patch filenames follow the same conventions as the monthly 
          distribution. <ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/dev.shtml">

          As of mid 2002, Wine consists of over 1 million lines of C code,
          written by more than 300 developers from dozens of countries around
          the world. Wine is in active use by an estimated 100K people. Wine

        <para>
          Large software projects are never finished, only released. In any
          case Wine is chasing a moving target since every new release of 
          Windows contains new API calls or variations to the existing ones.

        <para>
          Because Wine is being developed by volunteers, it is difficult to
          predict when it will be ready for general release. But due to the
          much increased interest by companies in porting apps via Wine, Wine
          development is constantly getting more and more active. Right now
          we are working on releasing Wine 0.9 during 2003

        <para>
          The best would be if the Windows API was fully documented, so Wine
          could be a perfect "clean-room" implementation. Seeing the source
          code might make it harder to prove that no copyright violations have
          taken place. That said, the documentation is often bad, nonexistent,
          and even misleading where it exists, so a fair amount of reverse
          engineering have been necessary, particularly in the shell (Explorer)
          interface.

          As always, the faster your CPU, the better. Having a math coprocessor

        <para>
          If you can run X smoothly on your UNIX system now, you should be 
          able to run Wine and MS Windows applications just fine too, depending
          on how memory hungry the application is.
        </para>
        <para>
          A Wine workstation will work with 16 megabytes of RAM and a 16 
          megabyte swap partition as long as you have a reasonable graphics 
          card. Most applications will run reasonably with 64/64 Mb, 
          interactive games are likely to need more. You can run Wine with 8/8,
          but it is going to be unusably slow and very constraining on the 
          applications you can run. If you wish to be part of the development
          team and program Wine itself, be aware that the debugger is rather 
          memory intensive. Some have suggested that 64 megabytes is the
          minimum RAM needed for Wine development, although some are able to 
          work (albeit slowly) with 24 megabytes of physical RAM and lots of
          swap space.

          Wine is getting to be quite large, and building from scratch takes a

          Yes, but only if the operating system supports mounting those types

          You do not need a licensed and installed copy of DOS or MS Windows to
          install, configure and run Wine. However, Wine has to be able to

        </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          Many folks have successfully installed and run some small programs
          in their UNIX filesystem without having a DOS partition or MS 
          Windows. However, in many cases you need a directory and file 
          infrastructure that is similar to an existing Windows installation.
          Some applications' installation programs want to distribute some of
          the package's files into the /windows and /windows/system 
          directories in order to run, and unless these exist on your UNIX 
          file system, those programs will not install correctly and probably
          will not run well, if at all.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you have a DOS partition with MS Windows installed in it, make
          sure that your UNIX system can 'see' this partition (check your 
          /etc/fstab file or mount the partition manually) so that Wine can
          run the MS Windows binaries located in the DOS partition. To run
          without a DOS partition, you need to set a UNIX path to be your 
          drive C, and make sure that the /windows and /windows/system 
          directories point to some place that actually exist.
        </para>
        <para>
          Here's an example, copied from a machine which has no DOS partition
          but successfully runs Wine:
        </para>
        <screen>
    [Drive C]      
          Path=/var/lib/wine
          Type=hd
          Label=MS-DOS
          Filesystem=win95
    [wine]
          Windows=c:\windows
          System=c:\windows\system
          Temp=e:\
          Path=c:\windows;c:\windows\system;c:
        </screen>
        <para>
         In <filename>/var/lib/wine/windows</filename>, you will need to
         install a <filename>win.ini</filename> config file that you might
         find on a typical MS Windows 3.1 machine. The directory
         <filename>/var/lib/wine/windows/system</filename> should exist, but
         doesn't need to contain anything. However, to use MS DLLs, you can
         copy them into that directory. Note that this is a contravention of
         the Windows licence unless Windows is properly installed on the
         machine. If you have DOS/MS Windows installed on your system, you can
         mount that partition at bootup by modifying the file 
         <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> in your UNIX partition (assuming that
         the UNIX kernel supports the DOS/MS Windows filesystem type).
        </para>
        <para>
          If you edit this file by hand, it should contain something similar
          to the following:
        </para>
        <screen>
/dev/hda1 /dosc msdos uid=0,gid=100,umask=007 0 0
        </screen>
        <para>
          This will allow you to read and write to the DOS partition without

          Wine is window manager independent, so the X window manager you
          choose to run has (almost) no bearing on your ability to run MS
          Windows programs under Wine. Wine uses standard X libraries, so no
          additional ones are needed. Wine has its own window management,
          which acts like MS Windows. It can be turned off to use the native
          window manager by modifying Managed or Desktop settings as described

        <para>
          Simple answer: you CAN'T. Windows demands direct access to the
          hardware and cannot get it with Wine and UNIX in the way
        </para>
        <para>
          Wine is supposed to be used WITHOUT Windows primarily. If you want
          to use a Windows installation, then use an existing installation 
          alongside the UNIX installation (see the dual-boot HOWTO for your OS
          for more details). Or alternatively use the cabextract utility to
          extract Windows install archives to a directory that you want to use
          as Wine's Windows tree.

      <answer>
        <para>
          Wine requires that you have a config file as 
          <filename>~/.wine/config</filename>. The format of this file is
          explained in the <filename>wine.conf</filename> man page. The file
          <filename>documentation/samples/config</filename> ( 
          <ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/source/documentation/samples/config">
          http://www.winehq.com/source/documentation/samples/config</ulink>) 
          contains a config file example. More explicit directions can be 
          found in the <filename>README</filename> file (
          <ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/source/README">
          http://www.winehq.com/source/README</ulink>) that will be located in
          the base Wine directory after you gunzip and untar the distribution

          Upgrading the wine installation does not affect the existing wine

        <para>
          I'd say Win98SE is the best version to use with Wine, as it's fairly
          widespread amongst developers and relatively old. Using Win2K files
          is <emphasis>definitely</emphasis> worse than a plain no-windows 
          Wine install, and Win ME is said to be problematic, too (as probably
          no developer uses it). In short: all Win9x &lt;= W98SE are good.

          The normal Wine releases don't have .exe extensions registered for

          If you can program C, that's a good start. Download the sources via
          CVS, subscribe to the mailing lists, look around the source, and pay
          attention to the comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine newsgroup and the 
          mailing lists (<ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/dev.shtml#ml">
          http://www.winehq.com/dev.shtml#ml</ulink>). See if there's anything
          that you think you can fix or work on. You won't have much trouble
          finding areas that need work in Wine (grep for FIXMEs in the source).

          Wine is not implementing an MFC replacement nor does it intend to.
          However it is possible (with a lot of work) to compile the MFC from
          source and thus produce an <filename>mfc42.dll.so</filename> library.

          You really shouldn't want to do this. If there's a quirk in Wine 
          you need to work around, it's much better to fix it in Wine (after
          all you're a developer, so you should be able to gather enough help
          and knowledge to fix it for real).
