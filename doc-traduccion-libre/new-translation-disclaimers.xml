Hello!

disclaimers. Please check below if the transcription is 
accurate. Ensure your name and electronic mail address is 
written the same way you intend to do it in the PO files

mailto:translation@iro.umontreal.ca for reporting any 
error. Also use this address for sending any pending PO file 
you might have. If you happen to have a home Web page, please 
send me the URL, as I now maintain this information as well 
in the Translation Project registry.
