The programs to which this applies includes all programs for 
which the Foundation is the copyright holder, and all other 
freely redistributable software programs.


The translations covered by this disclaimer include, without
limitation, translations of textual messages, glossaries, 
command or option names, user interface text, and the like, 
contained within or made for use via these programs.

I currently expect to work on the Spanish translation team

subsequently work on).

Given as a sealed instrument this [Fecha],
at [Tu_Localidad], Spain, and initially sent by e-mail, 
with a manually signed copy sent by post or hand delivery to the
Foundation.
