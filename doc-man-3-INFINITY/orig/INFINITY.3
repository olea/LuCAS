.SH NAME
INFINITY, NAN, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL - floating point constants
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#define _ISOC99_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.B INFINITY
.sp
.B NAN
.sp
.B HUGE_VAL
.br

.B HUGE_VALL

.SH DESCRIPTION
The macro
.B INFINITY
expands to a float constant representing positive infinity.

The macro
.B NAN
expands to a float constant representing a quiet NaN
(when supported). A
.I quiet
NaN is a NaN ("not-a-number") that does not raise exceptions
when it is used in arithmetic. The opposite is a
.I signalling
NaN. See IEC 60559:1989.

The macros
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
.BR HUGE_VALL
expand to constants of types double, float and long double, respectively,
that represent a large positive value, possibly plus infinity.

.SH AVAILABILITY
On a glibc system, the macro HUGE_VAL is always available.
Availability of the NAN macro can be tested using
.BR "#ifdef NAN" ,
and similarly for INFINITY, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL.
They will be defined by
.I <math.h>
if _ISOC99_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE is defined, or __STDC_VERSION__ is defined
and has a value not less than 199901L.
