.TH SIGACTION 2 2004-11-11 "Linux 2.6.9" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigaction, sigprocmask, sigpending, sigsuspend \-
POSIX signal handling API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp 2
.BI "int sigaction(int " signum ", const struct sigaction *" act ,
.BI "struct sigaction *" oldact );
.sp
.BI "int sigprocmask(int " how ", const sigset_t *" set ,
.BI "sigset_t *" oldset );
.sp
.BI "int sigpending(sigset_t *" set );
.sp
.BI "int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *" mask );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR sigaction ()
system call is used to change the action taken by a process on
receipt of a specific signal.
.PP
.I signum
specifies the signal and can be any valid signal except
.B SIGKILL
and
.BR SIGSTOP .
.PP
If
.I act
is non\-null, the new action for signal
.I signum
is installed from
.IR act .
If
.I oldact
is non\-null, the previous action is saved in
.IR oldact .
.PP
The
.I sigaction
structure is defined as something like
.sp
.RS
.nf
struct sigaction {
    void (*sa_handler)(int);
    void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
    sigset_t sa_mask;
    int sa_flags;
    void (*sa_restorer)(void);
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
On some architectures a union is involved - do not assign to both
.I sa_handler
and
.IR sa_sigaction .
.PP
The
.I sa_restorer
element is obsolete and should not be used.
POSIX does not specify a
.I sa_restorer
element.
.PP
.I sa_handler
specifies the action to be associated with
.I signum
and may be
.B SIG_DFL
for the default action, 
.B SIG_IGN
to ignore this signal, or a pointer to a signal handling function.
This function receives the signal number as its only argument.
.PP
.I sa_sigaction
also specifies the action to be associated with
.IR signum .
This function receives the signal number as its first argument, a
pointer to a
.I siginfo_t
as its second argument and a pointer to a
.I ucontext_t
(cast to void *) as its third argument.
.PP
.I sa_mask
gives a mask of signals which should be blocked during execution of
the signal handler.  In addition, the signal which triggered the handler
will be blocked, unless the
.B SA_NODEFER
flag is used.
.PP
.I sa_flags
specifies a set of flags which modify the behaviour of the signal handling
process. It is formed by the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B SA_NOCLDSTOP
If
.I signum
is
.BR SIGCHLD ,
do not receive notification when child processes stop (i.e., when they
receive one of
.BR SIGSTOP ", " SIGTSTP ", " SIGTTIN
or
.BR SIGTTOU )
or resume (i.e., they receive
.BR SIGCONT )
(see
.BR wait (2)).
.TP
.B SA_NOCLDWAIT
(Linux 2.6 and later)
.\" To be precise: Linux 2.5.60 -- MTK
If
.I signum
is
.BR SIGCHLD ,
do not transform children into zombies when they terminate.
See also
.BR waitpid (2).
.TP
.B SA_RESETHAND
Restore the signal action to the default state once the signal handler
has been called.
.B SA_ONESHOT
is an obsolete, non-standard synonym for this flag.
.TP
.BR SA_ONSTACK
Call the signal handler on an alternate signal stack provided by 
.BR sigaltstack (2).
If an alternate stack is not available, the default stack will be used.
.TP
.B SA_RESTART
Provide behaviour compatible with BSD signal semantics by making certain
system calls restartable across signals.
.TP
.B SA_NODEFER
Do not prevent the signal from being received from within its own signal
handler.
.B SA_NOMASK
is an obsolete, non-standard synonym for this flag.
.TP
.B SA_SIGINFO
The signal handler takes 3 arguments, not one.  In this case,
.I sa_sigaction
should be set instead of
.IR sa_handler .
(The
.I sa_sigaction
field was added in Linux 2.1.86.)
.RE
.PP
The
.I siginfo_t
parameter to
.I sa_sigaction
is a struct with the following elements
.sp
.RS
.nf
.ta 4 13 24
siginfo_t {
	int	si_signo;	/* Signal number */
	int	si_errno;	/* An errno value */
	int	si_code;	/* Signal code */
	pid_t	si_pid;	/* Sending process ID */
	uid_t	si_uid;	/* Real user ID of sending process */
	int	si_status;	/* Exit value or signal */
	clock_t	si_utime;	/* User time consumed */
	clock_t	si_stime;	/* System time consumed */
	sigval_t	si_value;	/* Signal value */
	int	si_int;	/* POSIX.1b signal */
	void *	si_ptr;	/* POSIX.1b signal */
	void *	si_addr;	/* Memory location which caused fault */
	int	si_band;	/* Band event */
	int	si_fd;	/* File descriptor */
}
.fi
.RE

.IR si_signo ", " si_errno " and " si_code
are defined for all signals.
The rest of the struct may be a union, so that one should only
read the fields that are meaningful for the given signal.
POSIX.1b signals and
.B SIGCHLD
fill in
.IR si_pid " and " si_uid .
.BR 
.B SIGCHLD
also fills in
.IR si_status ", " si_utime " and " si_stime .
.IR si_int " and " si_ptr
are specified by the sender of the POSIX.1b signal.
.\" See
.\" .BR sigqueue (2)
.\" for more details.
.BR SIGILL , 
.BR SIGFPE ,
.BR SIGSEGV , 
and
.B SIGBUS
fill in
.I si_addr
with the address of the fault.
.B SIGPOLL
fills in
.IR si_band " and " si_fd .

.I si_code
indicates why this signal was sent.  It is a value, not a bitmask.  The
values which are possible for any signal are listed in this table:

.PP
The
.BR sigprocmask ()
call is used to change the list of currently blocked signals. The 
behaviour of the call is dependent on the value of
.IR how ,
as follows.
.RS
.TP
.B SIG_BLOCK
The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and the
.I set
argument.
.TP
.B SIG_UNBLOCK
The signals in
.I set
are removed from the current set of blocked signals.  It is legal to
attempt to unblock a signal which is not blocked.
.TP
.B SIG_SETMASK
The set of blocked signals is set to the argument
.IR set .
.RE
.PP
If
.I oldset
is non\-null, the previous value of the signal mask is stored in
.IR oldset .
.PP
The
.BR sigpending ()
call allows the examination of pending signals (ones which have been
raised while blocked).  The signal mask of pending signals is stored
in
.IR set .
.PP
The
.BR sigsuspend ()
call temporarily replaces the signal mask for the process with that
given by 
.I mask
and then suspends the process until a signal is received.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR sigaction (),
.BR sigprocmask (),
and
.BR sigpending ()
return 0 on success and \-1 on error.
.BR sigsuspend ()
always returns \-1, normally with the error
.BR EINTR .

.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.IR act ", " oldact ", " set ", " oldset
or 
.I mask
point to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.
.TP
.B EINTR
System call was interrupted.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid signal was specified.  This will also be generated if an attempt
is made to change the action for
.BR SIGKILL " or " SIGSTOP ", "
which cannot be caught.
.SH NOTES
It is not possible to block 
.BR SIGKILL " or " SIGSTOP
with the sigprocmask call.  Attempts to do so will be silently ignored.
.PP
According to POSIX, the behaviour of a process is undefined after it
ignores a
.BR SIGFPE ,
.BR SIGILL ,
or
.BR SIGSEGV
signal that was not generated by
.BR kill ()
or
.BR raise ().
Integer division by zero has undefined result.
On some architectures it will generate a
.B SIGFPE
signal.
(Also dividing the most negative integer by \-1 may generate SIGFPE.)
Ignoring this signal might lead to an endless loop.
.PP
POSIX.1-1990 disallowed setting the action for
.B SIGCHLD
to
.BR SIG_IGN .
POSIX.1-2001 allows this possibility, so that ignoring
.B SIGCHLD
can be used to prevent the creation of zombies (see
.BR wait (2)).
Nevertheless, the historical BSD and System V behaviours for ignoring
.B SIGCHLD
differ, so that the only completely portable method of ensuring that
terminated children do not become zombies is to catch the
.B SIGCHLD
signal and perform a
.BR wait (2)
or similar.
.PP
POSIX.1-1990 only specified
.BR SA_NOCLDSTOP .
POSIX.1-2001 added
.BR SA_NOCLDWAIT ,
.BR SA_RESETHAND ,
.BR SA_NODEFER ,
and
.BR SA_SIGINFO .
Use of these latter values in
.I sa_flags
may be less portable in applications intended for older
Unix implementations.
.PP
Support for
.B SA_SIGINFO
was added in Linux 2.2.
.PP
The
.B SA_RESETHAND
flag is compatible with the SVr4 flag of the same name.
.PP
The
.B SA_NODEFER
flag is compatible with the SVr4 flag of the same name under kernels
1.3.9 and newer.  On older kernels the Linux implementation 
allowed the receipt of any signal, not just the one we are installing
(effectively overriding any
.I sa_mask
settings).
.PP
.\" FIXME What "library" is being referred to in the following sentence?
The
.BR SA_RESETHAND " and " SA_NODEFER
names for SVr4 compatibility are present only in library versions 3.0.9
and greater.
.PP
.BR sigaction ()
can be called with a null second argument to query the current signal
handler. It can also be used to check whether a given signal is valid for
the current machine by calling it with null second and third arguments.
.PP
See
.BR sigsetops (3)
for details on manipulating signal sets.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX, SVr4.  SVr4 does not document the EINTR condition.

.SH UNDOCUMENTED
Before the introduction of
.B SA_SIGINFO
it was also possible to get some additional information,
namely by using a
.I sa_handler
with second argument of type
.IR "struct sigcontext".
See the relevant kernel sources for details.
This use is obsolete now.
