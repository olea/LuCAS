.TH MSGCTL 2 2004-11-10 "Linux 2.6.9" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
msgctl \- message control operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B
#include <sys/types.h>
.B
#include <sys/ipc.h>
.B
#include <sys/msg.h>
.fi
.sp
.BI "int msgctl(int " msqid ,
.BI "int " cmd ,
.BI "struct msqid_ds *" buf );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR msgctl ()
performs the control operation specified by
.I cmd
on the message queue with identifier
.IR msqid .
.PP
The
.I msqid_ds
data structure is defined in <sys/msg.h> as follows:
.nf
.in +4n

struct msqid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm msg_perm;     /* Ownership and permissions
    time_t          msg_stime;    /* Time of last msgsnd() */
    time_t          msg_rtime;    /* Time of last msgrcv() */
    time_t          msg_ctime;    /* Time of last change */
    unsigned long   __msg_cbytes; /* Current number of bytes in 
                                     queue (non-standard) */
    msgqnum_t       msg_qnum;     /* Current number of messages 
                                     in queue */
    msglen_t        msg_qbytes;   /* Maximum number of bytes 
                                     allowed in queue */
    pid_t           msg_lspid;    /* PID of last msgsnd() */
    pid_t           msg_lrpid;    /* PID of last msgrcv() */

};
.in -4n
.fi
.PP
The
.I ipc_perm
structure is defined in <sys/ipc.h> as follows
(the highlighted fields are settable using
.BR IPC_SET ):
.PP
.nf
.in +4n
struct ipc_perm {
    key_t key;            /* Key supplied to msgget() */
    uid_t \fBuid\fP;            /* Effective UID of owner */
    gid_t \fBgid\fP;            /* Effective GID of owner */
    uid_t cuid;           /* Effective UID of creator */
    gid_t cgid;           /* Effective GID of creator */
    unsigned short \fBmode\fP;  /* Permissions */
    unsigned short seq;   /* Sequence number */
};
.in -4n
.fi
.PP
Valid values for
.I cmd
are:
.TP
.B IPC_STAT
Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with
.I msqid
into the
.I msqid_ds
structure pointed to by
.IR buf .
The caller must have read permission on the message queue.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
Write the values of some members of the
.I msqid_ds
structure pointed to by
.I buf
to the kernel data structure associated with this message queue,
updating also its
.I msg_ctime
member.
The following members of the structure are updated: 
.IR msg_qbytes ,
.IR msg_perm.uid ,
.IR msg_perm.gid ,
and (the least significant 9 bits of)
.IR msg_perm.mode .
The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner
.RI ( msg_perm.uid )
or creator 
.RI ( msg_perm.cuid )
of the message queue, or the caller must be privileged.
Appropriate privilege (Linux: the
.B CAP_IPC_RESOURCE
capability) is required to raise the
.I msg_qbytes
value beyond the system parameter
.BR MSGMNB .
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
Immediately remove the message queue,
awakening all waiting reader and writer processes (with an error
return and
.I errno
set to
.BR EIDRM ).
The calling process must have appropriate privileges
or its effective user\-ID must be either that of the creator or owner
of the message queue.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the return value will be 0
otherwise \-1
with
.I errno
indicating the error.
.SH ERRORS
On failure,
.I errno
is set to one of the following:
.TP 11
.B EACCES
The argument
.I cmd
is equal to
.B IPC_STAT
or
.BR MSG_STAT ,
but the calling process does not have read permission on the message queue
.IR msqid ,
and does not have the
.B CAP_IPC_OWNER
capability.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The argument
.I cmd
has the value
.B IPC_SET
or
.BR IPC_STAT ,
but the address pointed to by
.I buf
isn't accessible.
.TP
.B EIDRM
The message queue was removed.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid value for
.I cmd
or
.IR msqid .
.TP
.B EPERM
The argument
.I cmd
has the value
.B IPC_SET
or
.BR IPC_RMID ,
but the effective user ID of the calling process is not the creator
(as found in
.IR msg_perm.cuid )
or the owner
(as found in
.IR msg_perm.uid )
of the message queue,
and the process is not privileged (Linux: it does not have the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability).
.SH NOTES
Various fields in the \fIstruct msqid_ds\fP were shorts under Linux 2.2
and have become longs under Linux 2.4. To take advantage of this,
a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice.
(The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an IPC_64 flag in
.IR cmd .)
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID.  SVID does not document the EIDRM error condition.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR msgget (2),
.BR msgrcv (2),
.BR msgsnd (2),
.BR ipc (5),
.BR capabilities (7)
