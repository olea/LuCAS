.TH SIGINTERRUPT 3  1993-04-13 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
siginterrupt \- allow signals to interrupt system calls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int siginterrupt(int " sig ", int " flag );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsiginterrupt()\fP function changes the restart behaviour when
a system call is interrupted by the signal \fIsig\fP.  If the \fIflag\fP 
argument is false (0), then system calls will be restarted if interrupted 
by the specified signal \fIsig\fP.  This is the default behaviour in
Linux.  However, when a new signal handler is specified with the
\fBsignal\fP(2) function, the system call is interrupted by default.
.PP
If the \fIflags\fP argument is true (1) and no data has been transferred,
then a system call interrupted by the signal \fIsig\fP will return \-1
and the global variable \fIerrno\fP will be set to \fBEINTR\fP.
.PP
If the \fIflags\fP argument is true (1) and data transfer has started,
then the system call will be interrupted and will return the actual
amount of data transferred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBsiginterrupt()\fP function returns 0 on success, or \-1 if the
signal number \fIsig\fP is invalid.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The specified signal number is invalid.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
BSD 4.3
