.SH NAME
difftime \- calculate time difference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "double difftime(time_t " time1 ", time_t " time0 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdifftime()\fP function returns the number of seconds elapsed
between time \fItime1\fP and time \fItime0\fP, represented as a double.
The two times are specified in calendar time, which represents the time
elapsed since the Epoch
(00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899
.SH NOTES
This function is required by ANSI C.
On a POSIX system, time_t is an arithmetic type, and one could just
define
.RS
.nf
#define difftime(t1,t0) (double)(t1 - t0)
.fi
.RE
when the possible overflow in the subtraction is not a concern.
