.TH CLOCK 3  2002-06-14 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
clock \- Determine processor time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.B clock_t clock(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B clock()
function returns an approximation of processor time used by the program.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The value returned is the CPU time used so far as a
.BR clock_t ;
to get the number of seconds used, divide by
.BR CLOCKS_PER_SEC .
If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot
be represented, the function returns the value (clock_t)-1. 
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ANSI C.
POSIX requires that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 independent
of the actual resolution.
.SH NOTES
The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the start of the program;
subtract the value returned from a call to
.B clock()
at the start of the program to get maximum portability.
.PP
Note that the time can wrap around.  On a 32bit system where
CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 this function will return the same
value approximately every 72 minutes.
.PP
On several other implementations,
the value returned by 
.BR clock ()
also includes the times of any children whose status has been
collected via
.BR wait ()
(or another wait-type call).
Linux does not include the times of waited-for children in the
value returned by
.BR clock ().
.\" I have seen this behaviour on Irix 6.3, and the OSF/1, HP/UX, and
.\" Solaris manual pages say that clock() also does this on those systems.
.\" POSIX 1003.1-2001 doesn't explicitly allow this, nor is there an
.\" explicit prohibition. -- MTK
The
.B times()
function, which explicitly returns (separate) information about the 
caller and its children, may be preferable.
