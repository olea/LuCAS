.TH IOPERN 2 2004-05-27 "Linux 2.6.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
ioperm \- set port input/output permissions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
/* for libc5 */
.br
.B #include <sys/io.h>
/* for glibc */
.sp
.BI "int ioperm(unsigned long " from ", unsigned long " num ", int " turn_on );
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIoperm\fP sets the port access permission bits for the process for
\fInum\fP bytes starting from port address \fBfrom\fP to the value
\fBturn_on\fP.  The use of \fBioperm\fP requires root privileges.

Only the first 0x3ff I/O ports can be specified in this manner.  For more
ports, the
.B iopl
function must be used.
Permissions are not inherited on fork, but on exec they are. This is
useful for giving port access permissions to non-privileged tasks.

This call is mostly for the i386 architecture.
On many other architectures it does not exist or will always
return an error.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid values for
.I from
or
.IR num .
.TP
.B EIO
(on ppc) This call is not supported.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process has insufficient privilege to call 
.BR ioperm ;
the
.B CAP_SYS_RAWIO
capability is required.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
\fBioperm\fP is Linux specific and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
.SH NOTES
Libc5 treats it as a system call and has a prototype in
.IR <unistd.h> .
Glibc1 does not have a prototype. Glibc2 has a prototype both in
.I <sys/io.h>
and in
.IR <sys/perm.h> .
Avoid the latter, it is available on i386 only.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR iopl (2),
.BR capabilities (7)
