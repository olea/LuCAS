In this package you have the source code for 'Seguridad en Unix y Redes', 
version 2.1 (July 2002), originally written by Antonio Villalon Huerta.

To get the PDF file just compile the TeX source code with the following command
line:
pdflatex unixsec ; bibtex unixsec ; pdflatex unixsec; pdflatex unixsec

Feel free to send me any comments to toni@aiind.upv.es

Enjoy!
