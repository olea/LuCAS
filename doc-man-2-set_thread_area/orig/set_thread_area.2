.TH "SET_THREAD_AREA" 2 "2003-02-21" "Linux 2.5.29" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
set_thread_area \- Set a Thread Local Storage (TLS) area
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <linux/unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <asm/ldt.h>
.sp
.BI "int set_thread_area (struct user_desc *" u_info );
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B set_thread_area
sets an entry in the current thread's Thread Local Storage (TLS) array. 
The TLS array entry set by
.B set_thread_area
corresponds to the value of
.I u_info->entry_number
passed in by the user. If this value is in bounds,
.B set_thread_area
copies the TLS descriptor pointed to by
.I u_info
into the thread's TLS array.
.PP
When
.B set_thread_area
is passed an
.I entry_number
of \-1, it uses a free TLS entry. If
.B set_thread_area
finds a free TLS entry, the value of 
.I u_info->entry_number
is set upon return to show which entry was changed.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B set_thread_area
returns 0 on success, and \-1 on failure, with
.I errno
set appropriately.

.SH "ERRORS"
.TP
.B EINVAL
\fIu_info->\fR\fIentry_number\fR is out of bounds.
.TP
.B EFAULT
\fIu_info\fR is an invalid pointer.
.TP
.B ESRCH
A free TLS entry could not be located.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.B set_thread_area
is Linux specific and should not be used in programs that are intended
to be portable.

.SH "VERSIONS"
A version of
.B set_thread_area
first appeared in Linux 2.5.29.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR get_thread_area (2).
