.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions check whether
.IR c ,
which must have the value of an
.B unsigned char
or
.BR EOF ,
falls into a certain character class according to the current locale.
.TP 
.B "isalnum()"
checks for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to
.BI "(isalpha(" c ") || isdigit(" c "))" \fR.
.TP
.B "isalpha()"
checks for an alphabetic character; in the standard \fB"C"\fP 
locale, it is equivalent to
.BI "(isupper(" c ") || islower(" c "))" \fR.
In some locales, there may be additional characters for which
.B  isalpha()
is true--letters which are neither upper case nor lower
case.  
.TP
.B "isascii()"
checks whether \fIc\fP is a 7-bit
.I unsigned char
value that fits into
the ASCII character set.  This function is a BSD extension
and is also an SVID extension.
.TP
.B "isblank()"
checks for a blank character; that is, a space or a tab.
.TP
.B "iscntrl()"
checks for a control character.
.TP
.B "isdigit()"
checks for a digit (0 through 9).
.TP
.B "isgraph()"
checks for any printable character except space.
.TP
.B "islower()"
checks for a lower-case character.
.TP
.B "isprint()"
checks for any printable character including space.
.TP
.B "ispunct()"
checks for any printable character which is not a space or an
alphanumeric character.
.TP
.B "isspace()"
checks for white-space characters.  In the
.B """C"""
and
.B """POSIX"""
locales, these are: space, form-feed
.RB ( '\ef' ),
newline
.RB ( '\en' ),
carriage return
.RB ( '\er' ),
horizontal tab
.RB ( '\et' ),
and vertical tab
.RB ( '\ev' ).
.TP
.B "isupper()"
checks for an uppercase letter.
.TP
.B "isxdigit()"
checks for a hexadecimal digits, i.e. one of
.nl
.BR "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f A B C D E F" .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The values returned are nonzero if the character
.I c
falls into the tested class, and a zero value 
if not.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ANSI - C, BSD 4.3.
\fBisascii()\fP is a BSD extension
and is also an SVID extension.
\fBisblank()\fP conforms to ISO C99 7.4.1.3.
.SH NOTE
The details of what characters belong into which class depend on the current
locale.  For example,
.B isupper()
will not recognize an A - umlaut as an uppercase letter in the default
.B "C"
locale.
