README for the Linux System Administrators' Guide

I needed to do the following to my Debian setup to get things to format
with DocBook and jadetex:

	- Append the following lines to /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf:
	
		% for jadetex
		main_memory.jadetex = 1100000
		hash_extra.jadetex = 15000
		pool_size.jadetex = 500000
		string_vacancies.jadetex = 45000
		max_strings.jadetex = 55000
		pool_free.jadetex = 47500
		nest_size.jadetex = 500
		param_size.jadetex = 1500
		save_size.jadetex = 5000
		stack_size.jadetex = 1500

	  This makes jadetex's memory pool be big enough to actually
	  format the SAG. TeX is stupid and doesn't use dynamic memory
	  allocation.
