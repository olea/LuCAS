>Compiling Squid is quite easy: you need the right tools to do the job,
though. First, let's go through getting the tools, then you can
extract the source code package, include optional Squid components (using
the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
> command) and then actually compile the distributed code
into a binary format.</P
><P
>A word of warning, though: this is the stage where most people run into
problems. If you haven't compiled source before, try and follow the
next section in order - it shouldn't be too bad. If you don't manage to get
Squid running, at least you have gained experience.</P

><P
>The GNU compiler is only distributed as source (creating a
<I

>chicken-and-egg</I
> problem if you do not have a compiler) you may have to
do an Internet search (using one of the standard search engines) to try and find a binary copy of the GNU compiler for your
system.
The Squid source is distributed in compressed form. First a standard tar
file is created. This file is then compressed with the GNU <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gzip</B
>
program. To decompress this file you need a copy of gzip.
GCC (The Gnu C Compiler) is the recommended compiler: the developers wrote
Squid with it, and it is available for almost all systems.</P

available for most platforms. Though a debugger is not necessary for
installation, but is very useful in the case of software bugs (as discussed

the downloaded Squid <B

file in one step, but for compatability's sake we are going to do it in two
steps. Decompress the tar file by running

compiled, which can mean that you have to recompile at a later stage. There
are two reasons that a feature can be disabled by default:</P
><DIV
CLASS="FORMALPARA"
><P
><B
>Operating system Compatibility. </B
>Although Squid is written in as generic a way possible, certain functions
(such as async-io, transparency and ARP-based access control lists) are not
available on all operating systems. When many operating systems cannot use
a feature, it is included as a compile time option.</P
></DIV

><B
>Efficiency. </B
>On a very lightly loaded cache, async-io can actually slow down requests
minutely. Some system administrators may wish to disable certain features
to speed up their caches.</P
></DIV
><P
>You may be wondering why there simply aren't config file options for these
less used features. For most of the features there really isn't a reason other
than (?minimalisim?). Why have code sitting in the executable that
isn't actually used? You can include the features that you might use at some
time in the future without detrimental effects (other than a slightly larger
binary), so as to avoid having to recompile the Squid source later on.</P
><P
>The configure program also has a second function: with some source code you
have to edit a header file which tell the compiler which function calls to
use on the system. This very often makes source compilation difficult. With
Squid, however, the GNU <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>configure</I
> script checks what programs,
libraries and function calls are available on your system. This simplifies
setup dramatically.</P
><P
>To make configure as generic as possible, it's actually a Bourne Shell
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>/bin/sh</I
> script. If you have replaced your <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>/bin/sh</I
> shell with a
less Posix-capable shell
(like ash) you may not be able to run configure. If this is the case you
will have to change the first line of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
> script to run
the full shell.</P
><P
>all source inclusion options are set with the command './configure option'.
On most systems root doesn't have a '.' in their search path for security
reasons, so you have to fully specify the path to the binary (hence the
'<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>/</I
>').</P
><P
>To turn more than one configuration option on at once you simply append
each option to the end of the command line.
You can, for example, change the prefix install directory and turn
Async-IO on with a command like the following (more on what each of these
options is for shortly).

Note that only the commonly used configuration options are included here.
To get a complete list of options you can run './configure --help'. Many of
the resulting options are standard to the GNU configure script that Squid
uses, and are used for some things like cross compilation.</P

></H3
><P
>The memory allocation routines included with many operating systems aren't
very good for the way that Squid allocates and uses memory.
Squid uses the memory subsystem more intensively than most programs,
since it's a single process which runs for an extended period of time and
continuously allocates and frees small sections of memory. On some systems
the Squid process size increases at a rapid rate. When it eventually
consumes all the memory on the system, it crashes.</P
><P
>This option enables a different system memory allocator: DL-Malloc, by
Doug Lea, which is known to be efficient for Squid's allocation patterns.</P
><P
>Squid <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>will</I
> increase in size as objects are added to the disk cache,
as discussed in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Hardware Requirements</I
> section. The index of
objects in the disk cache takes up RAM, so make sure that you have
sufficient memory in your system before deciding that the memory
allocation system is at fault.</P
><P
>If a recently started copy of Squid uses substantially less memory than one
that has been running for a few days (with the same size cache store), you
might want to configure Squid to use DL-Malloc.</P
><P
>The included DL-Malloc memory allocation routines are not thread-safe, so
you may not be able to use this option in conjunction with Async-IO.

>Squid 2.0 includes a major performance increase in the form of Async-IO.</P
><P
>It's important to remember that Squid is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>one</I
> processes. In many
Internet daemons, more than one copy runs at a time, so if one process is
by a system call, it does not effect the other running copies.</P
><P
>Squid is only one process. If the main loop stops running for some reason, all
connections are slowed. In all versions of Squid, the main loop uses the
select and poll system calls to decide which connections to service. As Squid
receives data from the server, it writes the data to disk and to the client.</P
><P
>To write data to disk, a file has to be opened on the cache drive.
When lots of clients are opening and closing connections to a busy cache, the
main loop has to make lots of calls to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>open</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>close</I
> network and
disk filehandles (note that the word <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filehandle</I
> can refer to both a
network connection and an on-disk file). These two functions block the flow of
all data through the cache. While waiting for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>open</I
> to return, Squid
cannot perform any other functions.</P
><P
>When you enable Async-IO, Squid 2.0 uses threads to open and close
filedescriptors. A thread is part of the main Squid program in most ways,
except that if it makes use of a blocking system call (such as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>open</I
>),
only the thread stops, not the main loop or other threads. Note that there
is not one thread per connection.</P
><P
>Using threads to make calls to blocking function calls reduces the latency
that a cache adds to each request. (People sometimes worry about the latency
that caches add, but if you have a fast enough cache the latency is not an
issue - the client sees no noticeable overhead. Network overhead normally
outweighs Squid overhead). Async-IO drastically reduces cache overhead when
you have a loaded cache.</P
><P
>Unfortunately Posix threads aren't available on all operating systems.
This ties your hardware choice into your choice of operating system, since
if your operating system does not support threads there may be no choice but
to use a faster system, or even to split the load between multiple machines.
(? need a table of machines that work ?)</P
><P
>You should probably try and run Squid with Async-IO enabled if you have a
few thousand requests per hour. Some systems only support threads properly
with a fair amount of initial setup. If your load is low and Async-IO doesn't
work straight away you can leave Squid in the default configuration.</P

headers, so logging user-agent headers allow you to see if someone using an

while while it could be reading and writing data for something that doesn't

is negligible on most machines, but under very high load the huge number of
calls can impact overall performance. Enabling the 'time-hack' option
makes Squid update the clock only once per second, reducing the overhead
dramatically on such caches. This does means that your log messages are less
accurate. The log accuracy is important to some people, though. When you have
accurate time stamps of how long transfers take, you can create graphs of
response time, and use them to decide when you need to upgrade your

>The most common problem for new installers is that there is a problem with
the installed compiler (or the headers) for the system.</P
><P
>To test this theory simply try and run configure with no options at all.
If you still get an error message it is almost certainly a compiler or header
file problem.</P
><P
>To make sure try and compile a program that uses some of the less used
system calls and see if this compiles.</P
><P
>If your compiler doesn't compile files correctly, you might want to check if 
he header files exist, and if they do, permissions on the directory and the
include files themselves.</P
><P
>If you have installed GCC in a non-standard directory, or if you are cross
compiling, you may need configure to append options to the GCC command it
uses during it's tests. You can get configure to append options to the GCC
command line by setting the 'CFLAGS' shell variable prior to running configure.
If, for example, you compiler only works when you you modify the default
include directory, you can get configure to append that option to the default
command line with a (Bourne Shell) command like:</P

></H3
><P
>Some configuration options exclude the use of others. This is another
common cause of problems. To test this you should just try and run configure
without any options at all, and see if the problem disappears. If so, you can
try and work out which option is causing the conflict by adding each option
to the configure command line one-by-one. You may find that you have to
choose between two options (for example Async-IO and the DL-Malloc routines).
In this case you may have to decide which of the options is the most important
in your setup.</P

as described in the configure section. Follow the same instructions
described there to find the offending option. (You should run <I

As a start, try running configure without any options at all and then see if
<I

a time to see which one causes the problem.</P
