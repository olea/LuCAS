>Now that your machine is ready for your Squid install, you need to download
and install the Squid program. This can be done in two ways: you can
download a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>source</I
> version and compile it, or you can download a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>precompiled binary</I
> version and install that, relying on someone else
to do the compilation for you.</P
><P
>Binary versions of Squid are generally easier to install than source
code versions, specifically if your operating system vendor distributes a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>package</I
> which you can simply install.</P
><P
>Installing Squid from source code is recommended. This method allows you to
turn on compile-time options that may not be included in distributed binary
versions (one of many examples: SNMP support is not included into the
source at compile time unless it is specifically included, and most binary
versions available do not include snmp support). If your operating
system has been optimized so that Squid can run better (let's say you have
increased the number of open filehandles per process) a precompiled binary
will not take advantage of this tuning, since your compiler header files are
probably different to the ones where the binaries where compiled.</P
><P
>It's also a little worrying running binaries that other people
distribute (unless, of course, they are officially supplied by your
operating system vendor): what if they have placed a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>trojan</I
> into
the binary version? To ensure the security of your system it is recommended
that you compile from the official source tree.</P
><P
>Since we suggest installing from source code first, we cover that first: if
you have to download a Squid binary from somewhere, simply skip to the next
sub-section: <I

especially if you are not familiar with the Squid version naming convention.
Squid is (as of this writing) in version 2. As features are added, the minor
version number is incremented (Squid 2.0 becomes Squid 2.1, then Squid 2.2
etc etc). Since new features may introduce new bugs, the first version including
new features is distributed as a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pre-release</I
> (or beta) version. The
first pre-release of Squid 1.2 is called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>squid-2.1.PRE1-src.tar.gz</B
>. The
second is <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>squid-2.1.PRE2-src.tar.gz</B
>. Once Squid is considered
stable, a general release version is distributed: the first release version
is called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>squid-2.0.RELEASE-src.tar.gz</B
>, the second (which would
include minor bugfixes) <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>squid-2.0.RELEASE2-src.tar.gz</B
>.</P
><P
>In short, files are named as follows:
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>squid-2.minor-version-number.stability-info.release-number.tar.gz</I
>.
Unless you are a Squid developer, you should download the last available
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>RELEASE</I
> version: you are less likely to encounter bugs this way.</P
><P
>Squid source is normally available via FTP (the File Transfer Protocol), so
you should be able to download Squid source by using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ftp</B
>
program, available on almost every Unix system. If you are not familiar
with ftp, you can simply select the mirror closest to you with your
browser and save the Squid source to your disk by right-clicking on the
filename and selecting <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>save as</B
> (do not simply click on the filename
- many browsers attempt to extract compressed files, printing the tar file 
to your browser window: this is definitely not what you want!). Once
the download is complete, transfer the file to the cache machine.</P

>Finding binary versions of Squid to install is easy: deciding which binary
to trust is more difficult. If you do not choose carefully, someone could
undermine your system security. If you cannot compile Squid, but know (and
trust) someone that can do it for you, get them to help. It's better than
downloading a version contributed by someone that you don't know.</P
><P
>The worst places to download precompiled packages from are sites that
accept contributions from the public at large: avoid files in paths like
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>incoming</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>uploads</I
>, since the source of the file is unknown.</P
><P
>Mailing lists are often good places to find compiled Software (though
people become irritated if you do not actually make a concerted effort to
find a trusted version before bothering the list). Regular contributors to
mailing lists have a reputation at stake, and are likely to provide binary
versions of software that actually match the official source.</P
><P
>Binaries compiled by people the core Squid developers (www.ircache.net) know
and trust are available at
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ftp://squid.nlanr.net/pub/contrib/binaries/</I
>. You may be able to find a
Squid binary for your operating system here.</P
><P
>Files can be distributed in many different ways. Generally Squid is
tranformed into a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>package</I
> that can be installed with some <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>package tool</I
>. There are many competing package managers, so there is no way of
covering them all here.</P
