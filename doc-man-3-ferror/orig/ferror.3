.SH NAME
clearerr, feof, ferror, fileno \- check and reset stream status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "void clearerr(FILE *" stream );
.br
.BI "int feof(FILE *" stream );
.br
.BI "int ferror(FILE *" stream );
.br
.BI "int fileno(FILE *" stream );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B clearerr
clears the end-of-file and error indicators for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.PP
The function
.B feof
tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
returning non-zero if it is set.  The end-of-file indicator can only be
cleared by the function
.BR clearerr .
.PP
The function
.B ferror
tests the error indicator for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
returning non-zero if it is set.  The error indicator can only be reset by
the
.B clearerr
function.
.PP
The function
.B fileno
examines the argument
.I stream
and returns its integer descriptor.
.PP
For non-locking counterparts, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH ERRORS
These functions should not fail and do not set the external variable
.IR errno .
(However, in case
.B fileno
detects that its argument is not a valid stream, it must
return \-1 and set
.I errno
to
.BR EBADF .)
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The functions
.BR clearerr ,
.BR feof ,
and
.BR ferror
conform to X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR open (2),
.BR stdio (3),
.BR unlocked_stdio (3)
