.SH NAME
fseeko, ftello \- seek to or report file position
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int fseeko(FILE *" stream ", off_t " offset ", int " whence );
.sp
.BI "off_t ftello(FILE *" stream );
.BI 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfseeko()\fP and \fBftello()\fP functions are identical to
\fBfseek()\fP and \fBftell()\fP (see
.BR fseek (3)),
respectively, except that the \fIoffset\fP argument of \fBfseeko()\fP
and the return value of \fBftello()\fP is of type \fBoff_t\fP
instead of \fBlong\fP.
.LP
On many architectures both \fBoff_t\fP and \fBlong\fP are 32-bit types,
but compilation with
.RS
.nf
#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
.fi
.RE
will turn \fBoff_t\fP into a 64-bit type.
.SH NOTES
These functions are found on SysV-like systems.
They are not present in libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0 but available since glibc 2.1.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B fseeko
and
.B ftello
functions conform to SUSv2.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fseek (3)
