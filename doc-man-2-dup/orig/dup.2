.TH DUP 2 1994-08-21 "Linux 1.1.46" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
dup, dup2 \- duplicate a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int dup(int " oldfd );
.BI "int dup2(int " oldfd ", int " newfd );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR dup " and " dup2
create a copy of the file descriptor
.IR oldfd .

After successful return of \fBdup\fR or \fBdup2\fR,
the old and new descriptors may be used interchangeably. They share
locks, file position pointers and flags; for example, if the file
position is modified by using
.B lseek
on one of the descriptors, the position is also changed for the other.

The two descriptors do not share the close-on-exec flag, however.

.B dup
uses the lowest-numbered unused descriptor for the new descriptor.

.B dup2
.RI "makes " newfd " be the copy of " oldfd ", closing " newfd
first if necessary.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR dup " and " dup2
return the new descriptor, or \-1 if an error occurred (in which case,
.I errno
is set appropriately).
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I oldfd
isn't an open file descriptor, or
.I newfd
is out of the allowed range for file descriptors.
.TP
.B EBUSY
(Linux only) This may be returned by
.B dup2
during a race condition with open() and dup().
.TP
.B EINTR
The
.B dup2
call was interrupted by a signal.
.TP
.B EMFILE
The process already has the maximum number of file
descriptors open and tried to open a new one.
.SH WARNING
The error returned by
.B dup2
is different from that returned by
.BR fcntl( "..., " F_DUPFD ", ..." )
when
.I newfd
is out of range. On some systems
.B dup2
also sometimes returns
.B EINVAL
like
.BR F_DUPFD .
.SH BUGS
If
.I newfd
was open, any errors that would have been reported at
.IR close ()
time, are lost. A careful programmer will not use
.B dup2
without closing
.I newfd
first.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3. SVr4 documents additional
EINTR and ENOLINK error conditions.  POSIX.1 adds EINTR.
The EBUSY return is Linux-specific.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR close (2),
.BR fcntl (2),
.BR open (2)
