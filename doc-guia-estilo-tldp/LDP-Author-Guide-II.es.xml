        <para>Emacs has an SGML writing mode called psgml that is a
        major mode designed for editing SGML and XML documents. It
        provides <quote>syntax highlighting</quote> or <quote>pretty
        printing</quote> features that make SGML tags stand out, a way
        to insert tags other than typing them by hand, and the ability
        to validate your document while writing.</para> 
        <para>For users of Emacs, it's a great way to go, and many
        believe it to allow more versatility than any other SGML
        documentation tool. It works with DocBook, LinuxDoc and other
        DTDs equally well.</para>

      <title> Writing SGML using PSGML </title>

      <section><title> Introduction </title>
        <para> If you have installed a recent distribution, you may
        already have PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check,
        start Emacs and look for the PSGML documentation (<keycombo
        moreinfo="none"><keycap moreinfo="none">C</keycap><keycap
        moreinfo="none">h</keycap></keycombo><keycap
        moreinfo="none">i</keycap><keycap
        moreinfo="none">m</keycap><keycap
        moreinfo="none">psgml</keycap>).</para> 
        <para> From here on, we assume you have PSGML installed for
        use with a recent version of GNU Emacs. If that all went by
        too fast for you, see the free chapter from Bob Ducharme's
        SGML CD book: <ulink

      <section>
        <title> Updating your .emacs to use PSGML </title>
        <para> If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open
        a <emphasis>.sgml</emphasis> file and be ready for SGML
        editing, make sure PSGML can find the DocBook DTD. If your
        distribution already had PSGML set up for use with GNU Emacs,
        you probably do not have to do anything to get this to
        work. Otherwise, you may need to set an environment variable
        that tells PSGML where to look for the SGML catalog (the list
        of DTDs). </para> 
        <para> For example: </para>
        <screen format="linespecific">
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/catalog</command>
</screen>
        <para> Then add something like the following to your .emacs
        file: </para>

          the plain vim program, which is compatibile with the
          vi program and its commands.  Red Hat users will want the vim-common

          <command>vim</command>, which includes the highlighting and other
          features of vim over regular vi.  Red Hat
          users will want vim-enhanced.  Last, but certainly not least, is the
          X interface, which gives a graphical interface, menus, and mouse
          control.  To separate this from vim or vi, the command for graphical

            While VIM has an XML mode, this mode will not highlight known

            SGML mode if you like using the <command>:set ft=sgml</command>
            command.  Note that this will not have any affect on the file
            or its contents, only the highlighting within VIM.

        nedit is more
        for programmers, so it might seem a bit of overkill for new
        users and especially non-programmers.  All that aside, it's
        extremely powerful, allowing for color coding of tags.  Unlike
        epcEdit, nedit doesn't allow you to automatically insert tags
        or automatically validate your code.  However, it does allow
        for shell commands to be run against the contents of the
        window (as opposed to saving the file, then checking).  In a
        few minutes, I was able to set up <command>nsgmls</command> to
        validate the SGML and <command>aspell</command> to do my spell
        checking.

        <para>Since you can feed the contents of your window to
        outside programs, you can easily extend nedit to perform
        repetitive functions.  The example you'll see here is to

        <para> Select

        Menu...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  This will bring up the
        Shell Command dialog box, with all the shell commands  nedit
        has listed under the
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Shell</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.  Under
        Menu Entry, enter "SGML Validate".  This will be the entry
        you'll see on the screen.  Under Accelerator, press
        <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>.
        Once this menu item is set up, you can press
        <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>
        to have the SGML Validate automatically run.  Under Command
        Input, select window,  and under Command Output, select
        dialog.  Under Command to Execute, enter  nsgmls -sv.  Note
        that <command>nsgmls</command> has to be in your
        <envar>PATH</envar>  for this to work properly. </para>

        <para> Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and you'll now be back

        Validate</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press
        <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>.
        The <command>nedit</command> program will fire up and check
        the contents of the window.  The reason for using -sv is that
        the -v tells <command>nsgmls</command> to output the version
        of the program, so you'll always get output and know that
        <command>nsgmls</command> has run.  If all you get is a
        version number, then there are no errors with the document.
        If there are errors, then they'll be listed in the separate
        window for you to see.  If you have line numbers turned on
        (using
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Preferences</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
        Line Numbers</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) then finding the
        errors is much simpler, as <command>nsgmls</command> will list
        errors by their line number.</para>

      <para>This is a commerical application that has a free 30 day
      license available for download.  It is written in Java, allowing
      it to run on any platform that has a JVM (that is, works in both
      Windows and Linux).  The cost is $150USD for a single user
      license, and $75USD for a student license.</para>
      <para>On the plus sides of XMLEditor is the left side of the
      screen shows the heirarchy of the document (starting with Book
      and so on).  Selecting an item in the list brings you to that
      part of the document so you can edit it.  The right part of the
      screen shows the text without any markup or tags being shown.
      If you have external files as ELEMENTS (as the LDP Author Guide
      does), XMLEditor will follow the links and load the files, so
      you always work on the entire work.  On the minus side of this,
      you will get errors if a file (like index.xml) is
      missing.</para>

      <title>Including Images</title>
      <para>If you plan on including images in your HOWTOs, you can
      now do this, as LinuxDoc didn't support images.  Here's a sample
      way of including an image in your HOWTOS:</para> 
      <programlisting format="linespecific">
<sgmltag class="starttag">figure</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="starttag">title</sgmltag>LyX screen shot<sgmltag class="endtag">title</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.eps" format="eps"</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">imageobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.jpg" format="jpg"</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">imageobject</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="starttag">textobject</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag class="starttag">phrase</sgmltag>Screen shot of the LyX document processing program<sgmltag class="endtag">phrase</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag class="endtag">textobject</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag class="endtag">mediaobject</sgmltag>
<sgmltag class="endtag">figure</sgmltag>
</programlisting>
      <para>This is a better way than using <sgmltag
      class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> for two reasons.  First, 
      <sgmltag class="starttag">graphic</sgmltag> will be removed in 
      DocBook 5.0 in favor of the <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> tag.  So you may as well
      get started with the right way now.  Second, <sgmltag
      class="starttag">mediaobject</sgmltag> allows for different kinds
      of media based on what the output is. In this example, the first
      <sgmltag class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is an encapsulated
      PostScript(eps) file for use with formats derived from TeX such as
      DVI, PS, and PDF. The second <sgmltag
      class="starttag">imageobject</sgmltag> is a JPEG image for visual
      display, mostly for HTML output. The <sgmltag
      class="starttag">textobject</sgmltag> is presented if the output
      doesn't support graphics (TXT).  Think of it as an HTML <sgmltag
      class="starttag">alt</sgmltag> tag.</para>

    <section id="namedfiles">
      <title>Naming separate HTML files</title>
      <para>By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML
      processor will assign arbitrary names to the resulting files.
      This can be confusing to readers who may bookmark a page only to
      have it change.  Whatever
      your reasoning, here's how to make separate files named the way
      you want:</para> 
      <para>In your first <sgmltag class="starttag">article</sgmltag>
      tag (which should be the only one) include an id parameter and
      call it index.  This will make your tag look like this:</para> 

      <programlisting format="linespecific">
<sgmltag class="starttag">article id="index"</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

      <para>On the first <sgmltag class="starttag">chapter</sgmltag>
      tag, do not modify it, as it's usually an introduction and you
      want that on the first page.  For each other <sgmltag
      class="starttag">section</sgmltag> tag, include the id parameter
      and name it.  A name should include only alphanumeric characters,
      and it should be short enough to understand what it is.</para>

      <para> Second, get someone to review your documentation for
      factual correctness.  You can also ask for general
      comments.  The documentation that is

      possible, as there are millions of Linux users that may be
      reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing list talking
      about the subject, ask others from the list to help you
      out. </para>

      the GNOME Documentation Project</ulink>.  You can then merely
      include the license in its entirety in your document.  Due
      to its length, you may just want to provide a link
      to the source.</para>
      
      <para>If you choose to use a boilerplate copyright, simply copy it
      into your source code under a section called <quote>Copyright
      and Licenses</quote> or similar. Also include a copyright
      statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a new

      previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the
      dates they maintained that document. </para> 

      <para>You'll note that the licensing for the LDP Author Guide
      requires notification to the author of any derivative works or
      translations.  I also explicitly place any source code (aside
      from the SGML the Guide was written in) under the GPL. If your

      <para> Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject

      your HOWTO. This allows the maintainers to do their jobs faster,

    <title>Maintaining Your HOWTO</title>

    <para>
      Just because your HOWTO has now been published doesn't mean your
      job is done. HOWTOs need regular maintenance, to make sure they
      are up to date, and to improve them in response to readers' ideas
      and suggestions. A HOWTO is a living, growing body of knowledge,
      not just a publish-and-forget-it static document.
    </para>

    <para>
      You put your email address in the HOWTO, and politely requested
      feedback from your readers, right? Once you are officially published,
      you will begin to receive notes with suggestions. Some will be
      very valuable; others will request personal assistance. You should
      feel free to decline personal assistance if you cannot spare the
      time. Writing a HOWTO for the LDP doesn't commit you to a lifetime
      of free support for anyone on the net. It is polite to refer
      questioners to another resource, if you can. And, if you see a
      pattern in the questions you receive, it might indicate a topic
      you should add to your HOWTO.

      it. Also check the unmaintained HOWTOs and see if there is a
      subject there that you know about and can continue
      documenting. </para>

        <para>But I don't know SGML/Can't get the tools working/Don't
        like SGML</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para> That's okay.  You have the option of writing your first
        draft of the HOWTO in the format of your choice, then submit
        that to the LDP.  An LDP volunteer will review the document,
        then convert it into DocBook for you.  Once that's done,it will
        be easier for you to maintain the HOWTO.  If you have
        questions, you can always drop a line to the LDP volunteer or the
        LDP Docbook list
        at <email>docbook@en.tldp.org</email>.</para>
