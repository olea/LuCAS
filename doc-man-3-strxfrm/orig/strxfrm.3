.TH STRXFRM 3  1993-04-12 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strxfrm \- string transformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t strxfrm(char *" dest ", const char *" src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrxfrm()\fP function transforms the \fIsrc\fP string into a
form such that the result of \fBstrcmp()\fP on two strings that have
been transformed with \fBstrxfrm()\fP is the same as the result of
\fBstrcoll()\fP on the two strings before their transformation.  The
first \fIn\fP characters of the transformed string are placed in
\fIdest\fP.  The transformation is based on the program's current
locale for category \fILC_COLLATE\fP.  (See \fBsetlocale\fP(3)).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrxfrm()\fP function returns the number of bytes required to
store the transformed string in \fIdest\fP excluding the terminating
`\\0' character.  If the value returned is \fIn\fP or more, the
contents of \fIdest\fP are indeterminate.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899
.SH NOTES
In the \fI"POSIX"\fP or \fI"C"\fP locales \fBstrxfrm()\fP is equivalent to
copying the string with \fBstrncpy()\fP.
