.SH NAME
mem, kmem, port \- system memory, kernel memory and system ports
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMem\fP is a character device file
that is an image of the main memory of the
computer.  It may be used, for example, to examine (and even patch) the
system.
.LP
Byte addresses in mem are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.
.LP
Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results
when read-only or write-only bits are present.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
.br
chown root:mem /dev/mem
.sp
.RE
.LP
The file kmem is the same as mem, except that the kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
.br
chown root:mem /dev/kmem
.sp
.RE
.LP
\fBPort\fP is similar to mem, but the IO ports are accessed.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
.br
chown root:mem /dev/port
.sp
