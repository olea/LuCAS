.TH CHDIR 2 2004-06-23 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
chdir, fchdir \- change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int chdir(const char *" path );
.br
.BI "int fchdir(int " fd );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chdir
changes the current directory to that specified in
.IR path .
.PP
.B fchdir
is identical to
.BR chdir ;
the only difference is that the directory is given as an
open file descriptor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Depending on the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
general errors for
.B chdir
are listed below:
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix of
.IR path .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (2).)
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I path
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of
.I path
is not a directory.
.PP
The general errors for
.B fchdir
are listed below:
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission was denied on the directory open on
.IR fd .
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.SH NOTES
The prototype for
.B fchdir
is only available if
.B _BSD_SOURCE
is defined (either explicitly, or implicitly, by not defining
_POSIX_SOURCE or compiling with the -ansi flag).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The 
.B chdir
call is compatible with SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, 4.4BSD.  SVr4 documents
additional EINTR, ENOLINK, and EMULTIHOP error conditions but has
no ENOMEM.  POSIX.1 does not have ENOMEM or ELOOP error conditions.
X/OPEN does not have EFAULT, ENOMEM or EIO error conditions.

The
.B fchdir
call is compatible with SVr4, 4.4BSD and X/OPEN.
SVr4 documents additional EIO, EINTR, and ENOLINK error conditions.
X/OPEN documents additional EINTR and EIO error conditions.
