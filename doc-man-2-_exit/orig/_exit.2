.TH _EXIT 2 2001-11-17 Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
_exit, _Exit \- terminate the current process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "void _exit(int " status );
.sp
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "void _Exit(int " status );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B _exit
terminates the calling process "immediately". Any open file descriptors
belonging to the process are closed; any children of the process are
inherited by process 1, init, and the process's parent is sent a
.B SIGCHLD
signal.
.LP
The value
.I status
is returned to the parent process as the process's exit status, and
can be collected using one of the
.B wait
family of calls.
.LP
The function
.B _Exit
is equivalent to
.BR _exit .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions do not return.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3.
The function \fI_Exit()\fP was introduced by C99.
.SH NOTES
For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the transmission of
exit status, zombie processes, signals sent, etc., see
.BR exit (3).
.LP
The function
.B _exit
is like \fBexit()\fP, but does not call any functions registered
with the ANSI C
.B atexit
function, nor any registered signal handlers. Whether it flushes
standard I/O buffers and removes temporary files created with
.BR tmpfile (3)
is implementation-dependent.
On the other hand,
.B _exit
does close open file descriptors, and this may cause an unknown delay,
waiting for pending output to finish. If the delay is undesired,
it may be useful to call functions like \fItcflush()\fP before
calling \fB_exit()\fP.
Whether any pending I/O is cancelled, and which pending I/O may be
cancelled upon \fB_exit()\fP, is implementation-dependent.
