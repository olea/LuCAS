This is the proposal for a common structure for managing the man pages using
an structured publishing method for the ancient man roff format using
docbook and gettext for managing the translation process.

Each man page had its own CVS module named doc-man-section-name.
      
        The doc-man- prefix is not essential. It is used to differentiate
        the man pages modules from the others.

        The "section" infix is the number of the man page section. Is used
        to provide a separate namespace caused by the legacy man structure.

        The "name" suffix is the name of the man page in the legacy man
        structure.


Inside the doc-man-section-name module you can find the next items:

        doc-man-section-name.xml        (the man page translated and structured with docbook/XML)
        doc-man-section-name.aop        (an XML metadata file of how the document should be managed)
        doc-man-section-name.omf        (optionaly, a metadata bibliographic description of the man page)
        orig/
            name.section                (the original pristine source man page in English)
        orig-xml/
            doc-man-section-name.xml    (the original source document structured with docbook -doclifter output-)
        po/             
            doc-man-section-name.pot    (the source document -in English- in gettext format)
            lang.po                     (the translated document in gettext format, where lang is the ISO code of the language)
        Makefile/autogen-doc.sh         (administrative scripts for easy work)
