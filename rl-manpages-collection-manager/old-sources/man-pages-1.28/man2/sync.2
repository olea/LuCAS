.TH SYNC 2 "15 April 1995" "Linux 1.3.88" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sync \- commit buffer cache to disk.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.B int sync(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sync
first commits inodes to buffers, and then buffers to disk.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B sync
always returns 0.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3
.SH BUGS
According to the standard specification (e.g., SVID),
\fBsync()\fP schedules the writes, but may return before the actual
writing is done.
However, since version 1.3.20 Linux does actually wait.
(This still does not guarantee data integrity: modern disks have
large caches.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR fsync (2),
.BR fdatasync (2),
