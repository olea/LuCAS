.TH SIGBLOCK 2 "31 August 1995" "Linux 1.3" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigblock, siggetmask, sigsetmask, sigmask \- manipulate the signal mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigblock(int " mask );
.sp
.B int siggetmask(void);
.sp
.BI "int sigsetmask(int " mask );
.sp
.BI "int sigmask(int " signum );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This interface is made obsolete by
.BR sigprocmask (2).

The 
.B sigblock
system call adds the signals specified in
.I mask
to the set of signals currently being blocked from delivery.
.PP
The 
.B sigsetmask
system call replaces the set of blocked signals totally with a new set
specified in
.IR mask .
Signals are blocked if the corresponding bit in
.I mask
is a 1.
.PP
The current set of blocked signals can be obtained using
.BR siggetmask .
.PP
The 
.B sigmask
macro is provided to construct the mask for a given
.IR signum .

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B siggetmask
returns the current set of masked signals.

.B sigsetmask 
and
.B sigblock
return the previous set of masked signals.
.SH NOTES
Prototypes for these functions are only available if
.B __USE_BSD
is defined before 
.B <signal.h>
is included.
.PP
It is not possible to block
.B SIGKILL
or
.B SIGSTOP
\- this restriction is silently imposed by the system.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
4.4BSD. These function calls appeared in BSD 4.3 and are deprecated.
Use the POSIX signal facilities for new programs.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kill (2),
.BR sigprocmask (2),
.BR signal (7)
