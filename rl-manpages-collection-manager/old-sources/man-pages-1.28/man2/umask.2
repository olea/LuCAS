.TH UMASK 2 "9 August 1998" "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
umask \- set file creation mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/stat.h>
.sp
.BI "mode_t umask(mode_t " mask );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B umask
sets the umask to 
.I mask 
& 0777.

The umask is used by
.BR open (2)
to set initial file permissions on a newly-created file.
Specifically, permissions in the umask are turned off from
the \fBmode\fR argument to
.BR open (2)
(so, for example, the common umask default value of 022 results in new
files being created with permissions 0666 & ~022 = 0644 = rw-r--r--
in the usual case where the \fBmode\fR is specified as 0666).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This system call always succeeds and the previous value of the mask
is returned.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR creat (2),
.BR open (2)
