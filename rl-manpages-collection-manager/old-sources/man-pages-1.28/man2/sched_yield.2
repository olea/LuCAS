.TH SCHED_YIELD 2 "1996-04-10" "Linux 1.3.81" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sched_yield \- yield the processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sched.h>
.sp
\fBint sched_yield(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A process can relinquish the processor voluntarily without blocking by calling 
.BR sched_yield .
The process will then be moved to the end of the queue for its static
priority and a new process gets to run.

Note: If the current process is the only process in the highest
priority list at that time, this process will continue to run after a
call to
.BR sched_yield .

POSIX systems on which
.B sched_yield
is available define
.I _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
in <unistd.h>.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B sched_yield
returns 0.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1b (formerly POSIX.4)
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sched_setscheduler (2) 
for a description of Linux scheduling.
