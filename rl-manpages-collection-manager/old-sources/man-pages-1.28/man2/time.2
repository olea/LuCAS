.TH TIME 2 "9 September 1997" "Linux 2.0.30" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
time \- get time in seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "time_t time(time_t *" t );
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtime\fP returns the time since the Epoch
(00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970), measured in seconds.

If
.I t
is non-NULL,
the return value is also stored in the memory pointed to by
.IR t .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the value of time in seconds since the Epoch is returned.
On error, ((time_t)\-1) is returned, and \fIerrno\fP is set
appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I t
points outside your accessible address space.
.SH NOTES
POSIX.1 defines
.I seconds since the Epoch
as a value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a
specified time and the Epoch, according to a formula for conversion
from UTC equivalent to conversion on the naïve basis that leap
seconds are ignored and all years divisible by 4 are leap years.  This
value is not the same as the actual number of seconds between the time
and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because clocks are not
required to be synchronised to a standard reference.  The intention is
that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values be
consistent; see POSIX.1 Annex B 2.2.2 for further rationale.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3
.br
Under BSD 4.3, this call is obsoleted by
.BR gettimeofday (2).
POSIX does not specify any error conditions.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ctime (3),
.BR date (1),
.BR ftime (3),
.BR gettimeofday (2)
