.SH NAME
sigpause \- atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigpause(int " sigmask );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This interface is made obsolete by
.BR sigsuspend (2).

.B sigpause
assigns 
.I sigmask
to the set of masked signals and then waits for a signal to arrive; on
return the set of masked signals is restored.
.PP
.I sigmask
is usually 0 to indicate that no signals are to be blocked.
.B sigpause
always terminates by being interrupted, returning \-1 with
.I errno
set to
.BR EINTR .
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
4.4BSD.  The
.B sigpause
function call appeared in 4.3BSD and is deprecated.
