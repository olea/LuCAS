.TH SETRESUID 2 "16 July 1997" "Linux 2.1.44" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setresuid, setresgid \- set real, effective and saved user or group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setresuid(uid_t " ruid ", uid_t " euid ", uid_t " suid );
.br
.BI "int setresgid(gid_t " rgid ", gid_t " egid ", gid_t " sgid ); 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setresuid
(introduced in Linux 2.1.44)
sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID
of the current process.

Unprivileged user processes (i.e., processes with each of
real, effective and saved user ID nonzero) may change the real,
effective and saved user ID, each to one of:
the current uid, the current effective uid or the current saved uid.

The super-user may set real, effective and saved user ID to arbitrary values.

If one of the parameters equals \-1, the corresponding value is not changed.

Completely analogously,
.B setresgid
sets the real, effective and saved group ID's of the current process,
with the same restrictions for processes with each of
real, effective and saved user ID nonzero.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
The current process was not privileged and tried to change
the IDs is a not allowed way.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This call is Linux-specific.
