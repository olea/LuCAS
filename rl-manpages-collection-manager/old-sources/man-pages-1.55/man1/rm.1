.TH RM 1 1998-11 "GNU fileutils 4.0"
.SH NAME
rm \- remove files or directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "rm [" options "] " file...
.sp
POSIX options:
.B "[\-fiRr] [\-\-]"
.sp
GNU options (shortest form):
.B [\-dfirvR]
.B "[\-\-help] [\-\-version] [\-\-]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rm
removes each given
.IR file .
By default, it does not remove directories.
But when the \-r or \-R option is given, the entire directory tree
below the specified directory is removed (and there are no limitations
on the depth of directory trees that can be removed by `rm \-r').
It is an error when the last path component of
.I file
is either . or ..
(so as to avoid unpleasant surprises with `rm \-r .*' or so).
.PP
If the \-i option is given, or
if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the
.B "\-f"
option is not given,
.B rm
prompts the user for whether to remove the file, writing a question
to stderr and reading an answer from stdin.  If the response
is not affirmative, the file is skipped.
.SH "POSIX OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-f"
Do not prompt for confirmation. Do not write diagnostic messages.
Do not produce an error return status if the only errors were
nonexisting files.
.TP
.B "\-i"
Prompt for confirmation.
(In case both \-f and \-i are given, the last one given takes effect.)
.TP
.BR "\-r" " or " "\-R"
Recursively remove directory trees.
.TP
.B "\-\-"
Terminate option list.
.SH "SVID DETAILS"
The System V Interface Definition forbids removal of the
last link to an executable binary file that is being executed.
.SH "GNU DETAILS"
The GNU implementation (in fileutils-3.16) is broken in the sense
that there is an upper limit to the depth of hierarchies that can be
removed. (If necessary, a utility `deltree' can be used to remove
very deep trees.)
.SH "GNU OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-d, \-\-directory"
Remove directories with
.BR unlink (2)
instead of 
.BR rmdir (2),
and don't
require a directory to be empty before trying to unlink it.  Only
works if you have appropriate privileges.  Because unlinking a
directory causes any files in the deleted directory to become
unreferenced, it is wise to 
.BR fsck (8)
the filesystem after doing this.
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-force"
Ignore nonexistent files and never prompt the user.
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-interactive"
Prompt whether to remove each file. If the response is not affirmative,
the file is skipped.
.TP
.B "\-r, \-R, \-\-recursive"
Remove the contents of directories recursively.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Print the name of each file before removing it.
.SH "GNU STANDARD OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output, then exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-\-"
Terminate option list.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The variables LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES have the
usual meaning.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX 1003.2, except for the limitation on file hierarchy depth.
.SH NOTES
This page describes
.B rm
as found in the fileutils-4.0 package;
other versions may differ slightly.
Mail corrections and additions to aeb@cwi.nl.
Report bugs in the program to fileutils-bugs@gnu.ai.mit.edu.
.LP
Sometimes one wishes to recover deleted files.
It helps to have backups. It helps to use a trash directory,
so that removed files are only moved to the trash. But actually
removed files, although gone in principle, can sometimes be recovered.
