.SH NAME
ldd \- print shared library dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldd
.RB [OPTION]...
FILE...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ldd
prints the shared libraries required by each program or shared library
specified on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V\ \-\-version
Print the version number of
.BR ldd .
.TP
.B \-v\ \-\-verbose
Print all information, including e.g. symbol versioning information.
.TP
.B \-d\ \-\-data\-relocs
Perform relocations and report any missing objects (ELF only).
.TP
.B \-r\ \-\-function\-relocs
Perform relocations for both data objects and functions, and
report any missing objects or functions (ELF only).
.TP
.B \-\-help
Usage information.
.SH NOTES
The standard version of
.B ldd
comes with glibc2. Libc5 came with an older version, still present
on some systems. The long options are not supported by the libc5 version.
On the other hand, the glibc2 version does not support
.B \-V
and only has the equivalent
.BR \-\-version .
.LP
The libc5 version of this program will use the name of a library given
on the command line as-is when it contains a '/'; otherwise it
searches for the library in the standard locations. To run it
on a shared library in the current directory, prefix the name with "./".
.SH BUGS
.B ldd
does not work on a.out shared libraries.
.PP
.B ldd
does not work with some extremely old a.out programs which were
built before
.B ldd
support was added to the compiler releases.
If you use
.B ldd
on one of these programs, the program will attempt to run with
\fIargc\fP = 0 and the results will be unpredictable.
