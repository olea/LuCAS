.SH NAME
strnlen \- determine the length of a fixed-size string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t strnlen(const char *" s ", size_t " maxlen );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrnlen\fP function returns the number of characters in the string
pointed to by \fIs\fP, not including the terminating '\\0' character, but
at most \fImaxlen\fP. In doing this, \fBstrnlen\fP looks only at the first
\fImaxlen\fP characters at \fIs\fP and never beyond \fIs+maxlen\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrnlen\fP function returns \fIstrlen(s)\fP, if that is less than
\fImaxlen\fP, or \fImaxlen\fP if there is no '\\0' character among the first
\fImaxlen\fP characters pointed to by \fIs\fP.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is a GNU extension.
