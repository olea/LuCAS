.SH NAME
mkdtemp \- create a unique temporary directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "char *mkdtemp(char *" template );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmkdtemp()\fP function generates a uniquely-named temporary
directory from \fItemplate\fP. The last six characters of \fItemplate\fP
must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a string that makes the
.\" FIXME: were the permissions 0700 in all glibc versions ?
directory name unique. The directory is then created with
permissions 0700.
Since it will be modified,
.I template
must not be a string constant, but should be declared as a character array.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBmkdtemp()\fP function returns a pointer to the modified template
string on success, and \fBNULL\fP on failure, in which case
.IR errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The last six characters of \fItemplate\fP were not XXXXXX.
Now \fItemplate\fP is unchanged.

.TP
Also see \fBmkdir(2)\fP for other possible values for \fIerrno\fP.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
Introduced in OpenBSD 2.2.
.\" Also in NetBSD 1.4.
Available since glibc 2.1.91.
