.TH FCLOSE 3  1993-11-29 "BSD MANPAGE" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fclose \- close a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int fclose(FILE *" stream );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B fclose
function dissociates the named
.I stream
from its underlying file or set of functions.  If the stream was being used
for output, any buffered data is written first, using
.BR fflush (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
.B EOF
is returned and the global variable
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.  In either case any further access
(including another call to
.BR fclose "())"
to the stream results in undefined behaviour.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
The filedescriptor underlying
.I stream
is not valid.
.\"  This error cannot occur unless you are mixing ANSI C stdio operations and
.\"  low-level file operations on the same stream. If you do get this error,
.\"  you must have closed the stream's low-level file descriptor using
.\"  something like close(fileno(fp)).
.PP
The
.B fclose
function may also fail and set
.I errno
for any of the errors specified for the routines
.BR close (2),
.BR write (2)
or
.BR fflush (3).
.SH NOTES
Note that
.B fclose
only flushes the user space buffers provided by the
C library. To ensure that the data is physically stored
on disk the kernel buffers must be flushed too, e.g. with
.BR sync (2)
or
.BR fsync (2).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B fclose
function conforms to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR close (2),
.BR fcloseall (3),
.BR fflush (3),
.BR fopen (3),
.BR setbuf (3)
