.SH NAME
memmem \- locate a substring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "void *memmem(const void *" haystack ", size_t " haystacklen ,
.in +\w'void *memmem('u
.BI "const void *" needle ", size_t " needlelen  );
.in
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmemmem()\fP function finds the start of the first occurrence
of the substring \fIneedle\fP of length \fIneedlelen\fP in the memory
area \fIhaystack\fP of length \fIhaystacklen\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBmemmem()\fP function returns a pointer to the beginning of the
substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH BUGS
This function was broken in Linux libraries up to and including libc 5.0.9;
there the `needle' and `haystack' arguments were interchanged,
and a pointer to the end of the first occurrence of \fIneedle\fP
was returned.  Since libc 5.0.9 is still widely used, this is a
dangerous function to use.
.br
Both old and new libc's have the bug that if \fIneedle\fP is empty
\fIhaystack\fP-1 (instead of \fIhaystack\fP) is returned.
And glibc 2.0 makes it worse, and returns a pointer to the
last byte of `haystack'. This is fixed in glibc 2.1.
