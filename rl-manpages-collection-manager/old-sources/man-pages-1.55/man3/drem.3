.SH NAME
drem \- floating-point remainder function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double drem(double " x ", double " y );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdrem()\fP function computes the remainder of dividing \fIx\fP by
\fIy\fP.  The return value is \fIx\fP - \fIn\fP * \fIy\fP, where \fIn\fP
is the quotient of \fIx\fP / \fIy\fP, rounded to the nearest integer.
If the quotient is 1/2, it is rounded to the even number.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBdrem()\fP function returns the remainder, unless \fIy\fP is zero,
when the function fails and \fIerrno\fP is set.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
The denominator \fIy\fP is zero.
