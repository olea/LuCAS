.SH NAME
stdarg \- variable argument lists
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdarg.h>
.sp
.BI "void va_start(va_list " ap ", " last );
.br
.BI "" type " va_arg(va_list " ap ", " type );
.br
.BI "void va_end(va_list " ap );
.br
.BI "void va_copy(va_list " dest ", va_list " src );
.SH DESCRIPTION
A function may be called with a varying number of arguments of varying
types.  The include file
.I stdarg.h
declares a type
.B va_list
and defines three macros for stepping through a list of arguments whose
number and types are not known to the called function.
.PP
The called function must declare an object of type
.B va_list
which is used by the macros
.BR va_start ,
.BR va_arg ,
and
.BR va_end .
.SS va_start
The
.B va_start
macro initializes
.I ap
for subsequent use by
.B va_arg
and
.BR va_end ,
and must be called first.
.PP
The parameter
.I last
is the name of the last parameter before the variable argument list, i.e.,
the last parameter of which the calling function knows the type.
.PP
Because the address of this parameter may be used in the
.B va_start
macro, it should not be declared as a register variable,
or as a function or an array type.
.SS va_arg
The
.B va_arg
macro expands to an expression that has the type and value of the next
argument in the call.  The parameter
.I ap
is the 
.B va_list
.I ap
initialized by
.BR va_start .
Each call to
.B va_arg
modifies
.I ap
so that the next call returns the next argument.  The parameter
.I type
is a type name specified so that the type of a pointer to an object that
has the specified type can be obtained simply by adding a * to
.IR type .
.PP
The first use of the
.B va_arg
macro after that of the 
.B va_start
macro returns the argument after 
.IR last .
Successive invocations return the values of the remaining arguments.
.PP
If there is no next argument, or if
.I type
is not compatible with the type of the actual next argument (as promoted
according to the default argument promotions), random errors will occur.
.PP
If
.I ap
is passed to a function that uses
.BI va_arg( ap , type )
then the value of
.I ap
is undefined after the return of that function.
.SS va_end
Each invocation of
.B va_start
must be matched by a corresponding invocation of
.B va_end
in the same function. After the call
.BI va_end( ap )
the variable
.I ap
is undefined. Multiple transversals of the list, each
bracketed by
.B va_start
and
.B va_end
are possible.
.B va_end
may be a macro or a function.
.SS va_copy
.\" Proposal from clive@demon.net, 1997-02-28
An obvious implementation would have a
.B va_list
a pointer to the stack frame of the variadic function.
In such a setup (by far the most common) there seems
nothing against an assignment
.RS
.nf
	va_list aq = ap;
.fi
.RE
Unfortunately, there are also systems that make it an
array of pointers (of length 1), and there one needs
.RS
.nf
	va_list aq;
	*aq = *ap;
.fi
.RE
Finally, on systems where parameters are passed in registers,
it may be necessary for
.B va_start
to allocate memory, store the parameters there, and also
an indication of which parameter is next, so that
.B va_arg
can step through the list. Now
.B va_end
can free the allocated memory again.
To accommodate this situation, C99 adds a macro
.BR va_copy ,
so that the above assignment can be replaced by
.RS
.nf
	va_list aq;
	va_copy(aq, ap);
	...
	va_end(aq);
.fi
.RE
Each invocation of
.B va_copy
must be matched by a corresponding invocation of
.B va_end
in the same function.
Some systems that do not supply
.B va_copy
have
.B __va_copy
instead, since that was the name used in the draft proposal.
.SH EXAMPLES
The function
.I foo
takes a string of format characters and prints out the argument associated
with each format character based on the type.
.RS
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

void foo(char *fmt, ...) {
	va_list ap;
	int d;
	char c, *p, *s;

	va_start(ap, fmt);
	while (*fmt)
		switch(*fmt++) {
		case 's':			/* string */
			s = va_arg(ap, char *);
			printf("string %s\en", s);
			break;
		case 'd':			/* int */
			d = va_arg(ap, int);
			printf("int %d\en", d);
			break;
		case 'c':			/* char */
			/* need a cast here since va_arg only
			   takes fully promoted types */
			c = (char) va_arg(ap, int);
			printf("char %c\en", c);
			break;
		}
	va_end(ap);
}
.fi
.RE
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.BR va_start ,
.BR va_arg ,
and
.B va_end
macros conform to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``C89'').
C99 defines the
.B va_copy
macro.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
These macros are
.I not
compatible with the historic macros they replace.  A backward compatible
version can be found in the include file
.IR varargs.h .
.SH COMPARISON
The historic setup is:
.RS
.nf
#include <varargs.h>

void foo(va_alist) va_dcl {
	va_list ap;

	va_start(ap);
	while(...) {
		...
		x = va_arg(ap, type);
		...
	}
	va_end(ap);
}
.fi
.RE
On some systems,
.I va_end
contains a closing '}' matching a '{' in
.IR va_start ,
so that both macros must occur in the same function, and in a way
that allows this.
.SH BUGS
Unlike the
.B varargs
macros, the
.B stdarg
macros do not permit programmers to code a function with no fixed
arguments.  This problem generates work mainly when converting
.B varargs
code to
.B stdarg
code, but it also creates difficulties for variadic functions that wish to
pass all of their arguments on to a function that takes a
.B va_list
argument, such as
.BR vfprintf (3).
