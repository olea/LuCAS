.SH NAME
inet_ntop \- Parse network address structures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.B #include <arpa/inet.h>
.sp
.BI "const char *inet_ntop(int " "af" ", const void *" "src" ,
.BI "                      char *" "dst" ", size_t " "cnt" );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function converts the network address structure
.I src
in the
.I af
address family into a character string, which is copied to a character buffer
.IR dst ,
which is
.I cnt
bytes long.
.PP
.BR inet_ntop (3)
extends the
.BR inet_ntoa (3)
function to support multiple address families,
.BR inet_ntoa (3)
is now considered to be deprecated in favor of
.BR inet_ntop (3).
The following address families are currently supported:
.TP
.B AF_INET
.I src
points to a
.I struct in_addr
(network byte order format)
which is converted to an IPv4 network address in
the dotted-quad format, "\fIddd.ddd.ddd.ddd\fP".
The buffer
.I dst
must be at least
.B INET_ADDRSTRLEN
bytes long.
.TP
.B AF_INET6
.I src
points to a
.I struct in6_addr
(network byte order format)
which is converted to a representation of this address in the
most appropriate IPv6 network address format for this address.
The buffer
.I dst
must be at least
.B INET6_ADDRSTRLEN
bytes long.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B inet_ntop
returns a non-null pointer to
.IR dst .
NULL is returned if there was an error, with
.I errno
set to
.B EAFNOSUPPORT
if
.I af
was not set to a valid address family,
or to
.B ENOSPC
if the converted address string would exceed the size of
.IR dst
given by the
.I cnt
argument.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR inet_pton (3)
.SH BUGS
.B AF_INET6
converts
IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses
into an IPv6 format.
