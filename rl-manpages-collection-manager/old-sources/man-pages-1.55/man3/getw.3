.SH NAME
getw, putw \- input and output of words (ints)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int getw(FILE *" stream );
.nl
.BI "int putw(int " w ", FILE *" stream );
.nl
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgetw\fP reads a word (that is, an \fBint\fP) from \fIstream\fP. It's
provided for compatibility with SVID.  We recommend you use
\fBfread\fP(3) instead.
.P
\fBputw\fP writes the word \fIw\fP (that is, an \fBint\fP) to \fIstream\fP.  It
is provided for compatibility with SVID, but we recommend you use
\fBfwrite\fP(3) instead.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Normally, \fBgetw\fP returns the word read, and \fBputw\fP returns 0.
On error, they return \fBEOF\fP.
.SH BUGS
The value returned on error is also a legitimate data value.
\fBferror\fP(3) can be used to distinguish between the two cases.
