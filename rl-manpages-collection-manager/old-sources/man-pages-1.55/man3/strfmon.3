.TH STRFMON 3  2000-12-05 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strfmon \- convert monetary value to a string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <monetary.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t strfmon(char *" s ", size_t " max ", const char *" format ,
.B "...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrfmon()\fP function formats the specified amounts
according to the format specification \fIformat\fP and places the
result in the character array \fIs\fP of size \fImax\fP.
.PP
Ordinary characters in \fIformat\fP are copied to \fIs\fP
without conversion.  Conversion specifiers are introduced by a `%'
character. Immediately following it there can be zero or more
of the following flags:
.TP
.BI = f
The single-byte character
.I f
is used as the numeric fill character (to be used with
a left precision, see below).
When not specified, the space character is used.
.TP
.B ^
Do not use any grouping characters that might be defined
for the current locale. By default, grouping is enabled.
.TP
.BR ( " or " +
The ( flag indicates that negative amounts should be enclosed between
parentheses. The + flag indicates that signs should be handled
in the default way, that is, amounts are preceded by the locale's
sign indication, e.g., nothing for positive, "-" for negative.
.TP
.BR !
Omit the currency symbol.
.TP
.BR \-
Left justify all fields. The default is right justification.
.LP
Next, there may be a field width: a decimal digit string specifying
a minimum field width in bytes. The default is 0.
A result smaller than this width is padded with spaces
(on the left, unless the left-justify flag was given).
.LP
Next, there may be a left precision of the form "#" followed by
a decimal digit string. If the number of digits left of the
radix character is smaller than this, the representation is
padded on the left with the numeric fill character.
Grouping characters are not counted in this field width.
.LP
Next, there may be a right precision of the form "." followed by
a decimal digit string. The amount being formatted is rounded to
the specified number of digits prior to formatting.
The default is specified in the
.I frac_digits
and
.I int_frac_digits
items of the current locale.
If the right precision is 0, no radix character is printed.
(The radix character here is determined by LC_MONETARY, and may
differ from that specified by LC_NUMERIC.)
.LP
Finally, the conversion specification must be ended with a
conversion character. The three conversion characters are
.TP
.B %
(In this case the entire specification must be exactly "%%".)
Put a `%' character in the result string.
.TP
.B i
One argument of type double is converted using the locale's
international currency format.
.TP
.B n
One argument of type double is converted using the locale's
national currency format.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrfmon()\fP function returns the number of characters placed
in the array \fIs\fP, not including the terminating NUL character,
provided the string, including the terminating NUL, fits.
Otherwise, it sets
.I errno
to E2BIG, returns \-1, and the contents of the array is undefined.
.SH EXAMPLE
The call
.RS
.nf
strfmon(buf, sizeof(buf), "[%^=*#6n] [%=*#6i]",
        1234.567, 1234.567);
.fi
.RE
outputs
.RS
[ fl **1234,57] [ NLG  **1 234,57]
.RE
in the Dutch locale (with fl for "florijnen" and NLG for Netherlands Guilders).
The grouping character is very ugly because it takes as much space
as a digit, while it should not take more than half that,
and will no doubt cause confusion.
Surprisingly, the "fl" is preceded and followed by a space,
and "NLG" is preceded by one and followed by two spaces.
This may be a bug in the locale files. The Italian, Australian, Swiss
and Portuguese locales yield
.RS
[ L. **1235] [ ITL  **1.235]
.br
[ $**1234.57] [ AUD **1,234.57]
.br
[Fr. **1234,57] [CHF  **1.234,57]
.br
[ **1234$57Esc] [ **1.234$57PTE ]
