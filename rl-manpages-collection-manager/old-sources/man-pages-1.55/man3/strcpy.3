.TH STRCPY 3  1993-04-11 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strcpy, strncpy \- copy a string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strcpy(char *" dest ", const char *" src );
.sp
.BI "char *strncpy(char *" dest ", const char *" src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrcpy()\fP function copies the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fP
(including the terminating `\\0' character) to the array pointed to by 
\fIdest\fP.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination string 
\fIdest\fP must be large enough to receive the copy.
.PP
The \fBstrncpy()\fP function is similar, except that not more than
\fIn\fP bytes of \fIsrc\fP are copied. Thus, if there is no null byte
among the first \fIn\fP bytes of \fIsrc\fP, the result will not be
null-terminated.
.PP
In the case where the length of
.I src
is less than that of
.IR n ,
the remainder of
.I dest
will be padded with nulls.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrcpy()\fP and \fBstrncpy()\fP functions return a pointer to
the destination string \fIdest\fP.
.SH BUGS
If the destination string of a \fBstrcpy()\fP is not large enough
(that is, if the programmer was stupid/lazy, and failed to check
the size before copying) then anything might happen.
Overflowing fixed length strings is a favourite cracker technique.
