.TH EXPM1 3  1995-09-16 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
expm1, log1p \- exponential minus 1, logarithm of 1 plus argument
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double expm1(double " x );
.sp
.BI "double log1p(double " x );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI expm1( x )
returns a value equivalent to `exp (\fIx\fP) - 1'. It is
computed in a way that is accurate even if the value of \fIx\fP is near
zero--a case where `exp (\fIx\fP) - 1' would be inaccurate due to
subtraction of two numbers that are nearly equal.
.PP
.BI log1p( x )
returns a value equivalent to `log (1 + \fIx\fP)'. It is computed in a way
that is accurate even if the value of \fIx\fP is near zero.
