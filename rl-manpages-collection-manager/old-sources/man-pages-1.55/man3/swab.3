.SH NAME
swab \- swap adjacent bytes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "void swab(const void *" from ", void *" to ", ssize_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBswab()\fP function copies \fIn\fP bytes from the array pointed
to by \fIfrom\fP to the array pointed to by \fIto\fP, exchanging
adjacent even and odd bytes.  This function is used to exchange data
between machines that have different low/high byte ordering.
.LP
This function does nothing when \fIn\fP is negative.
When \fIn\fP is positive and odd, it handles \fIn\fP-1 bytes
as above, and does something unspecified with the last byte.
(In other words, \fIn\fP should be even.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBswab()\fP function returns no value.
