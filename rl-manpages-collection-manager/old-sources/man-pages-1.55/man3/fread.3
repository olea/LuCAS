.SH NAME
fread, fwrite \- binary stream input/output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t fread(void *" ptr ", size_t " size ", size_t " nmemb ,
.BI "FILE *" stream );
.sp
.BI "size_t fwrite(const void *" ptr ", size_t " size ", size_t " nmemb ,
.BI "FILE *" stream );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B fread
reads
.I nmemb
elements of data, each
.I size
bytes long, from the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
storing them at the location given by
.IR ptr .
.PP
The function
.B fwrite
writes
.I nmemb
elements of data, each
.I size
bytes long, to the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
obtaining them from the location given by
.IR ptr .
.PP
For non-locking counterparts, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B fread
and
.B fwrite
return the number of items successfully read or written (i.e., not the
number of characters).  If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is
reached, the return value is a short item count (or zero).
.PP
.B fread
does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use
.BR feof (3)
and
.BR ferror (3)
to determine which occurred.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The functions
.B fread
and
.B fwrite
conform to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR feof (3),
.BR ferror (3),
.BR unlocked_stdio (3)
