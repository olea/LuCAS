.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR ttyname ()
returns a pointer to the NUL-terminated pathname of the terminal device
that is open on the file descriptor \fIfd\fP, or \fBNULL\fP on error
(for example, if \fIfd\fP is not connected to a terminal).
The return value may point to static data, possibly overwritten by the
next call.
The function
.BR ttyname_r ()
stores this pathname in the buffer
.I buf
of length
.IR buflen .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.BR ttyname ()
returns a pointer to a pathname on success. On error,
.B NULL
is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
The function
.BR ttyname_r ()
returns 0 on success, and an error number upon error.
.SH ERRORS

.I errno
by a failing

.BR ttyname_r ():
