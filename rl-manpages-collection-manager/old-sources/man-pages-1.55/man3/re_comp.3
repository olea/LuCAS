.TH re_comp 3 1995-07-14 Linux "GNU"
.SH NAME
re_comp, re_exec \- BSD regex functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <regex.h>
.sp
.BI "char *re_comp(char *" regex );
.br
.BI "int re_exec(char *" string );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B re_comp
is used to compile the null-terminated regular expression pointed to by
.IR regex .
The compiled pattern occupies a static area, the pattern buffer,
which is overwritten by subsequent use of
.BR re_comp .
If
.I regex
is
.BR NULL ,
no operation is performed and the pattern buffer's contents are not
altered.

.B re_exec
is used to assess whether the null-terminated string pointed to by
.I string
matches the previously compiled
.IR regex .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B re_comp
returns
.B NULL
on successful compilation of
.I regex
otherwise it returns a pointer to an appropriate error message.

.B re_exec
returns 1 for a successful match, zero for failure.
