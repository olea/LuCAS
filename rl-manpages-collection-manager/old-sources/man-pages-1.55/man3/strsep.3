.TH STRSEP 3  1993-04-12 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strsep \- extract token from string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strsep(char **" stringp ", const char *" delim );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If *\fIstringp\fP is NULL, the \fBstrsep()\fP function returns NULL
and does nothing else. Otherwise, this function finds the first token
in the string *\fIstringp\fP, where tokens
are delimited by symbols in the string \fIdelim\fP.
This token is terminated with a `\\0' character
(by overwriting the delimiter)
and *\fIstringp\fP is updated to point past the token.
In case no delimiter was found, the token is taken to be
the entire string *\fIstringp\fP, and *\fIstringp\fP is made NULL.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrsep()\fP function returns a pointer to the token,
that is, it returns the original value of *\fIstringp\fP.
.SH NOTES
The \fBstrsep()\fP function was introduced as a replacement for
\fBstrtok()\fP, since the latter cannot handle empty fields.
However, \fBstrtok()\fP conforms to ANSI-C and hence is more portable.
.SH BUGS
This function suffers from the same problems as \fBstrtok()\fP.
In particular, it modifies the original string. Avoid it.
