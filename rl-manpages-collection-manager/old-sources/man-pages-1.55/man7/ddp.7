.SH NAME
ddp \- Linux AppleTalk protocol implementation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.br
.B #include <netatalk/at.h> 
.sp
.IB ddp_socket " = socket(PF_APPLETALK, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);"
.br 
.IB raw_socket " = socket(PF_APPLETALK, SOCK_RAW, " protocol ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux implements the Appletalk protocols described in 
.IR "Inside Appletalk" .
Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in
the kernel. They are designed to be used via the 
.B netatalk 
protocol
libraries. This page documents the interface for those who wish or need to
use the DDP layer directly.
.PP
The communication between Appletalk and the user program works using a
BSD-compatible socket interface. For more information on sockets, see
.BR socket (7). 
.PP
An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the 
.BR socket (2) 
function with a 
.B PF_APPLETALK
socket family argument. Valid socket types are 
.B SOCK_DGRAM
to open a 
.B ddp 
socket or
.B SOCK_RAW
to open a 
.B raw 
socket. 
.I protocol 
is the Appletalk protocol to be received or sent. For 
.B SOCK_RAW 
you must specify
.BR ATPROTO_DDP .
.PP
Raw sockets may be only opened by a process with effective user id 0 or when the process has the 
.B CAP_NET_RAW 
capability.  
.SH "ADDRESS FORMAT"
An Appletalk socket address is defined as a combination of a network number,
a node number, and a port number. 
.PP
.RS
.nf
.ta 4n 20n 32n
struct at_addr {
	u_short	s_net;
	u_char	s_node;
};

struct sockaddr_atalk {
	sa_family_t	sat_family;	/* address family */
	u_char	sat_port;	/* port */
	struct at_addr	sat_addr;	/* net/node */
};
.ta
.fi
.RE 
.PP
.I sat_family
is always set to 
.B AF_APPLETALK. 
.I sat_port
contains the port. The port numbers below 129 are known as 
.B reserved ports.
Only processes with the effective user id 0 or the 
.B CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE 
capability may 
.BR bind (2)  
to these sockets. 
.I sat_addr 
is the host address.
The 
.I net
member of 
.B struct at_addr
contains the host network in network byte order.  The value of 
.B AT_ANYNET 
is a 
wildcard and also implies \(lqthis network.\(rq
The 
.I node
member of 
.B struct at_addr
contains the host node number.  The value of 
.B AT_ANYNODE 
is a 
wildcard and also implies \(lqthis node.\(rq The value of 
.B ATADDR_BCAST 
is a link
local broadcast address.
.\" XXX this doesn't make sense [johnl]
.SH "SOCKET OPTIONS"
No protocol-specific socket options are supported.
.SH SYSCTLS
IP supports a sysctl interface to configure some global AppleTalk parameters. 
The sysctls can be accessed by reading or writing the 
.B /proc/sys/net/atalk/* 
files or with the 
.BR sysctl (2)
interface.
.TP
.B aarp-expiry-time
The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry expires.
.TP
.B aarp-resolve-time
The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry is resolved. 
.TP
.B aarp-retransmit-limit
The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the node is declared
dead. 
.TP
.B aarp-tick-time
The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.
.PP
The default values match the specification and should never need to be
changed.

.SH IOCTLS
All ioctls described in
.BR socket (7) 
apply to ddp.

.\" XXX Add a chapter about multicasting

.SH NOTES
Be very careful with the 
.B SO_BROADCAST
option \- it is not privileged in Linux. It is easy to overload the network
with careless sending to broadcast addresses. 
.SH VERSIONS
Appletalk is supported by Linux 2.0 or higher. The 
.B sysctl 
interface is
new in Linux 2.2.
.SH ERRORS
.\" XXX document all errors. We should really fix the kernels to give more uniform
.\"     error returns (ENOMEM vs ENOBUFS, EPERM vs EACCES etc.)  
.TP
.B ENOTCONN
The operation is only defined on a connected socket, but the socket wasn't
connected.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid argument passed. 
.TP
.B EMSGSIZE 
Datagram is bigger than the DDP MTU.
.TP
.B EACCES
The user tried to execute an operation without the necessary permissions. These
include sending to a broadcast address without having the broadcast flag set,
and trying to bind to a reserved port without effective user id 0 or 
.BR CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE . 
.TP
.B EADDRINUSE
Tried to bind to an address already in use.
.TP
.BR ENOMEM " and " ENOBUFS
Not enough memory available. 
.TP
.BR ENOPROTOOPT " and " EOPNOTSUPP
Invalid socket option passed.
.TP
.B EPERM
User doesn't have permission to set high priority, make a configuration change,
or send signals to the requested process or group,
.TP
.B EADDRNOTAVAIL
A non-existent interface was requested or the requested source address was
not local.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
Operation on a nonblocking socket would block.
.TP
.B ESOCKTNOSUPPORT
The socket was unconfigured, or an unknown socket type was requested.
.TP
.B EISCONN
.BR connect (2) 
was called on an already connected socket.
.TP
.B EALREADY
A connection operation on a non-blocking socket is already in progress.
.TP
.B ECONNABORTED
A connection was closed during an 
.BR accept (2). 
.TP
.B EPIPE
The connection was unexpectedly closed or shut down by the other end.
.TP
.B ENOENT
.B SIOCGSTAMP 
was called on a socket where no packet arrived.
.TP
.B EHOSTUNREACH
No routing table entry matches the destination address. 
.TP
.B ENODEV 
Network device not available or not capable of sending IP.
.TP
.B ENOPKG 
A kernel subsystem was not configured.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The basic AppleTalk socket interface is compatible with 
.B netatalk 
on BSD-derived systems. Many BSD systems fail to check
.B SO_BROADCAST
when sending broadcast frames; this can lead to compatibility problems.
.PP
The 
raw
socket mode is unique to Linux and exists to support the alternative CAP
package and AppleTalk monitoring tools more easily.
.SH BUGS
There are too many inconsistent error values. 
.PP
The ioctls used to configure routing tables, devices, AARP tables and other
devices are not yet described.
