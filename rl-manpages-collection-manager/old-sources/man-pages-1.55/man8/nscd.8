.SH NAME
/usr/sbin/nscd - name service cache daemon
.SH DESCRIPTION
Nscd is a daemon that provides a cache for the most common name service
requests. The default configuration file,
.IR /etc/nscd.conf ,
determines the behavior of the cache daemon. See
.BR nscd.conf (5).

Nscd provides cacheing for the
.BR passwd (5),
.BR group (5),
and
.BR hosts(5)
databases through standard libc interfaces, such as
.BR getpwnam (3),
.BR getpwuid (3),
.BR getgrnam (3),
.BR getgrgid (3),
.BR gethostbyname (3),
and others. Each cache has a separate TTL (time-to-live) for its data;
modifying the local database
.RI ( /etc/passwd ,
and so forth) causes the cache to become invalidated within fifteen
seconds. Note that the shadow file is specifically not cached.
.BR getspnam (3)
calls remain uncached as a result.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
will give you a list with all options and what they do.

.SH NOTES
Nscd doesn't know anything about the underlaying protocols for a
service. This also means, that if you change
.I /etc/resolv.conf
for DNS queries, nscd will continue to use the old one if you have
configured
.I /etc/nsswitch.conf
to use DNS for host lookups. In such a case, you need to restart
nscd.
