.TH BRK 2 1993-07-21 "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
brk, sbrk \- change data segment size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int brk(void *" end_data_segment );
.sp
.BI "void *sbrk(ptrdiff_t " increment );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B brk
sets the end of the data segment to the value specified by
.IR end_data_segment ,
when that value is reasonable, the system does have enough memory
and the process does not exceed its max data size (see
.BR setrlimit (2)).

.B sbrk
increments the program's data space by
.I increment
bytes.
.B sbrk
isn't a system call, it is just a C library wrapper.
Calling
.B sbrk
with an increment of 0 can be used to find the current
location of the program break.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.B brk
returns zero, and
.B sbrk
returns a pointer to the start of the new area.  On error, \-1 is returned,
and
.I errno
is set to
.BR ENOMEM .
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
BSD 4.3

.BR brk " and " sbrk
are not defined in the C Standard and are deliberately excluded from the
POSIX.1 standard (see paragraphs B.1.1.1.3 and B.8.3.3).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR execve (2),
.BR getrlimit (2),
.BR malloc (3)
