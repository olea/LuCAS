.TH IOPL 2 1993-07-24 "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iopl \- change I/O privilege level
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/io.h>
.sp
.BI "int iopl(int " level );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iopl
changes the I/O privilege level of the current process, as specified in
.IR level .

This call is necessary to allow 8514-compatible X servers to run under
Linux.  Since these X servers require access to all 65536 I/O ports, the
.B ioperm
call is not sufficient.

In addition to granting unrestricted I/O port access, running at a higher
I/O privilege level also allows the process to disable interrupts.  This
will probably crash the system, and is not recommended.

Permissions are inherited by fork and exec. 

The I/O privilege level for a normal process is 0.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I level
is greater than 3.
.TP
.B EPERM
The current user is not the super-user.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
\fBiopl\fP is Linux specific and should not be used in processes
intended to be portable.
.SH NOTES
Libc5 treats it as a system call and has a prototype in
.IR <unistd.h> .
Glibc1 does not have a prototype. Glibc2 has a prototype both in
.I <sys/io.h>
and in
.IR <sys/perm.h> .
Avoid the latter, it is available on i386 only.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ioperm (2)
