.TH MSYNC 2 1996-04-12 "Linux 1.3.86" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
msync \- synchronize a file with a memory map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/mman.h>
.sp
.B #ifdef _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES
.br
.B #ifdef _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO
.sp
.BI "int msync(void *" start ", size_t " length ", int " flags );
.sp
.B #endif
.br
.B #endif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B msync
flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped
into memory using
.BR mmap (2)
back to disk.  Without use of this call
there is no guarantee that changes are written back before
.BR munmap (2)
is called.  To be more precise, the part of the file that
corresponds to the memory area starting at
.I start
and having length
.I length
is updated.  The
.I flags
argument may have the bits MS_ASYNC, MS_SYNC and MS_INVALIDATE set,
but not both MS_ASYNC and MS_SYNC.
MS_ASYNC specifies that an update be scheduled, but the call
returns immediately.
MS_SYNC asks for an update and waits for it to complete.
MS_INVALIDATE asks to invalidate other mappings of the same file
(so that they can be updated with the fresh values just written).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.BR EINVAL
.I start
is not a multiple of PAGESIZE, or any bit other than
MS_ASYNC | MS_INVALIDATE | MS_SYNC is set in
.IR flags.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The indicated memory (or part of it) was not mapped.
