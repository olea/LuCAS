.TH SIGRETURN 2 1995-08-21 "Linux 1.3.20" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigreturn \- return from signal handler and cleanup stack frame
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "int sigreturn(unsigned long " __unused );
.SH DESCRIPTION
When the Linux kernel creates the stack frame for a signal handler, a
call to
.B sigreturn
is inserted into the stack frame so that the the signal handler will
call
.B sigreturn
upon return. This inserted call to
.B sigreturn
cleans up the stack so that the process can restart from where it was
interrupted by the signal.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B sigreturn
never returns.
.SH WARNING
The
.B sigreturn
call is used by the kernel to implement signal handlers. It should
.B never
be called directly. Better yet, the specific use of the
.I __unused
argument varies depending on the architecture.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.B sigreturn
is specific to Linux and should not be used in programs intended to be
portable.
