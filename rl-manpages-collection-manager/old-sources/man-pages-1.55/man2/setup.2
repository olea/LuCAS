.TH SETUP 2 1996-05-03 "Linux 1.2.9" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setup \- setup devices and file systems, mount root file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.B _syscall0(int, setup);
.sp
.B int setup(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setup
is called once from within
.IR linux/init/main.c .
It calls initialization functions for devices and file systems
configured into the kernel and then mounts the root file system.
.PP
No user process may call
.BR setup .
Any user process, even a process with super-user permission,
will receive
.BR EPERM .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B setup
always returns \-1 for a user process.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
Always, for a user process.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is Linux specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable, or indeed in any programs at all.
Since Linux 2.1.121, no such function exists anymore.
The calling sequence varied: it has had a single parameter
.I "void * BIOS"
and at other times a single parameter
.IR "int magic" .
