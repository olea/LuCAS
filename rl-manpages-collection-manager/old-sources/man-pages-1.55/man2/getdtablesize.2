.TH GETDTABLESIZE 2 2002-04-15 "Linux 2.4" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getdtablesize \- get descriptor table size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.B int getdtablesize(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B getdtablesize
returns the maximum number of files a process can have open,
one more than the largest possible value for a file descriptor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The current limit on the number of open files per process.
.SH NOTES
.B getdtablesize
is implemented as a libc library function. The glibc version calls
.BR getrlimit (2)
and returns the current
.B RLIMIT_NOFILE
limit, or
.B OPEN_MAX
when that fails.
The libc4 and libc5 versions return
.B OPEN_MAX
(set to 256 since Linux 0.98.4).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
.B getdtablesize
function first appeared in BSD 4.2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR close (2),
.BR dup (2),
.BR getrlimit (2),
.BR open (2)
