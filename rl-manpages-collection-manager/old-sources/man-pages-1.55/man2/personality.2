.TH PERSONALITY 2 2003-01-01 "Linux 2.0" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
personality \- set the process execution domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "long personality(unsigned long " persona );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each
process. Among other things, execution domains tell Linux how to map
signal numbers into signal actions. The execution domain system allows
Linux to provide limited support for binaries compiled under other
Unix-like operating systems.

This function will return the current
.B personality
when
.I persona
equals 0xffffffff. Otherwise, it will make the execution domain
referenced by
.I persona
the new execution domain of the current process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the previous
.I persona
is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The kernel was unable to change the personality.
.PP
.SH FILES
.I /usr/include/linux/personality.h
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.B personality
is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
