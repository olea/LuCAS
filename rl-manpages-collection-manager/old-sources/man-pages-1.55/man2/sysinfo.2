.TH SYSINFO 2 1997-08-25 "Linux 2.0" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sysinfo \- returns information on overall system statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/sysinfo.h>
.sp
.BI "int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *" info );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Until Linux 2.3.16,
.B sysinfo
used to return information in the following structure:

.RS
.nf
struct sysinfo {
	long uptime;             /* Seconds since boot */
	unsigned long loads[3];  /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
	unsigned long totalram;  /* Total usable main memory size */
	unsigned long freeram;   /* Available memory size */
	unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
	unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
	unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
	unsigned long freeswap;  /* swap space still available */
	unsigned short procs;    /* Number of current processes */
	char _f[22];             /* Pads structure to 64 bytes */
};
.fi
.RE

and the sizes were given in bytes. Since Linux 2.3.23 (i386), 2.3.48
(all architectures) the structure is

.RS
.nf
struct sysinfo {
	long uptime;             /* Seconds since boot */
	unsigned long loads[3];  /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
	unsigned long totalram;  /* Total usable main memory size */
	unsigned long freeram;   /* Available memory size */
	unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
	unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
	unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
	unsigned long freeswap;  /* swap space still available */
	unsigned short procs;    /* Number of current processes */
	unsigned long totalhigh; /* Total high memory size */
	unsigned long freehigh;  /* Available high memory size */
	unsigned int mem_unit;   /* Memory unit size in bytes */
	char _f[20-2*sizeof(long)-sizeof(int)]; /* Padding for libc5 */
};
.fi
.RE

and the sizes are given as multiples of \fImem_unit\fP bytes.

.B sysinfo
provides a simple way of getting overall system statistics.  This is more
portable than reading \fI/dev/kmem\fP.
For an example of its use, see intro(2).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
pointer to \fIstruct\ sysinfo\fP is invalid
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
.sp
The Linux kernel has a sysinfo system call since 0.98.pl6.
Linux libc contains a sysinfo() routine since 5.3.5, and
glibc has one since 1.90.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR proc (5)
