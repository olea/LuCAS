.TH CONNECT 2 1998-10-03 "Linux 2.2" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
connect \- initiate a connection on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.sp
.BI "int connect(int " sockfd ", const struct sockaddr *" serv_addr ,
.BI "socklen_t " addrlen );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file descriptor
.I sockfd
must refer to a socket.
If the socket is of type
.B SOCK_DGRAM
then the
.I serv_addr
address is the address to which datagrams are sent by default, and the only
address from which datagrams are received.  If the socket is of type
.B SOCK_STREAM
or
.BR SOCK_SEQPACKET ,
this call attempts to make a connection to another socket.  The other
socket is specified by
.IR serv_addr ,
which is an address (of length
.IR addrlen )
in the communications space of the socket.  Each
communications space interprets the
.I serv_addr
parameter in its own way.
.PP
Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully
.B connect
only once; connectionless protocol sockets may use
.B connect
multiple times to change their association.  Connectionless sockets may
dissolve the association by connecting to an address with the 
.I sa_family
member of
.B sockaddr 
set to 
.BR AF_UNSPEC .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the connection or binding succeeds, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is
returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
The following are general socket errors only.  There may be other
domain-specific error codes. 
.TP
.B EBADF
The file descriptor is not a valid index in the descriptor table.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The socket structure address is outside the user's address space.
.TP
.B ENOTSOCK
The file descriptor is not associated with a socket.
.TP
.B EISCONN
The socket is already connected.
.TP
.B ECONNREFUSED
No one listening on the remote address.
.TP
.B ETIMEDOUT
Timeout while attempting connection. The server may be too 
busy to accept new connections. Note that for IP sockets the timeout may
be very long when syncookies are enabled on the server.
.TP
.B ENETUNREACH
Network is unreachable.
.TP
.B EADDRINUSE
Local address is already in use.
.TP
.B EINPROGRESS
The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be completed
immediately.  It is possible to
.BR select (2)
or 
.BR poll (2) 
for completion by selecting the socket for writing. After 
.B select
indicates writability, use
.BR getsockopt (2)
to read the 
.B SO_ERROR
option at level 
.B SOL_SOCKET
to determine whether 
.B connect
completed successfully 
.RB ( SO_ERROR
is zero) or unsuccessfully 
.RB ( SO_ERROR
is one of the usual error codes listed here, 
explaining the reason for the failure).
.TP
.B EALREADY
The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt has not yet
been completed.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
No more free local ports or insufficient entries in the routing cache. For
.B PF_INET
see the 
.B net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
sysctl in 
.BR ip (7) 
on how to increase the number of local ports.
.TP
.B EAFNOSUPPORT
The passed address didn't have the correct address family in its 
.I sa_family
field.
.TP
.B EACCES, EPERM
The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without having the socket 
broadcast flag enabled or the connection request failed because of a local
firewall rule.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
.B connect
function first appeared in BSD 4.2).  SVr4 documents the additional
general error codes 
.BR EADDRNOTAVAIL , 
.BR EINVAL , 
.BR EAFNOSUPPORT , 
.BR EALREADY , 
.BR EINTR , 
.BR EPROTOTYPE , 
and
.BR ENOSR .  
It also
documents many additional error conditions not described here.
.SH NOTE
The third argument of
.B connect
is in reality an int (and this is what BSD 4.* and libc4 and libc5 have).
Some POSIX confusion resulted in the present socklen_t.
The draft standard has not been adopted yet, but glibc2 already
follows it and also has socklen_t. See also
.BR accept (2).
.SH BUGS
Unconnecting a socket by calling
.B connect
with a
.B AF_UNSPEC
address is not yet implemented.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR accept (2),
.BR bind (2),
.BR listen (2),
.BR socket (2),
.BR getsockname (2)
