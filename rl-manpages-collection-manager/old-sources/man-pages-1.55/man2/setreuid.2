.TH SETREUID 2 1994-08-02 "Linux 1.1.38" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setreuid, setregid \- set real and/or effective user or group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setreuid(uid_t " ruid ", uid_t " euid );
.br
.BI "int setregid(gid_t " rgid ", gid_t " egid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setreuid
sets real and effective user IDs of the current process.
Unprivileged users may only set the real user ID to
the real user ID or the effective user ID, and may only set
the effective user ID to the real user ID, the effective user ID
or the saved user ID.

Supplying a value of \-1 for either the real or effective user ID forces
the system to leave that ID unchanged.

If the real user ID is set or the effective user ID is set to a value 
not equal to the previous real user ID, the saved user ID will be set to the
new effective user ID.

Completely analogously,
.B setregid
sets real and effective group ID's of the current process,
and all of the above holds with "group" instead of "user".

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and changes other than (i)
swapping the effective user (group) ID with the real user (group) ID,
or (ii) setting one to the value of the other or (iii) setting the
effective user (group) ID to the value of the saved user (group) ID
was specified.
.SH NOTES
Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved user ID is
possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
BSD 4.3 (the
.B setreuid
and
.B setregid
function calls first appeared in 4.2BSD).
