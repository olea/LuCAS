.TH LISTEN 2 1993-07-23 "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
listen \- listen for connections on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.sp
.BI "int listen(int " s ", int " backlog );
.SH DESCRIPTION
To accept connections, a socket is first created with
.BR socket (2),
a willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming
connections are specified with
.BR listen ,
and then the connections are
accepted with
.BR accept (2).
The
.B listen
call applies only to sockets of type
.B SOCK_STREAM
or
.BR SOCK_SEQPACKET .
.PP
The
.I backlog
parameter defines the maximum length the queue of pending connections may
grow to.  If a connection request arrives with the queue full the client
may receive an error with an indication of
.B ECONNREFUSED
or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be
ignored so that retries succeed.
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of the 
.I backlog 
parameter on TCP sockets changed with Linux 2.2.
Now it specifies the queue length for 
.I completely 
established sockets waiting to be accepted, instead of the number of incomplete
connection requests. The maximum length of the queue for incomplete sockets
can be set using the 
.B tcp_max_syn_backlog
sysctl.
When syncookies are enabled there is no logical maximum 
length and this sysctl setting is ignored.
See 
.BR tcp (7)
for more information.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EADDRINUSE
Another socket is already listening on the same port.
.TP
.B EBADF
The argument
.I s
is not a valid descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOTSOCK
The argument
.I s
is not a socket.
.TP
.B EOPNOTSUPP
The socket is not of a type that supports the
.B listen 
operation.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
Single Unix, 4.4BSD, POSIX 1003.1g draft. The
.B listen
function call first appeared in 4.2BSD. 
.SH BUGS
If the socket is of type 
.BR AF_INET , 
and the
.I backlog
argument is greater
than the constant 
.B SOMAXCONN 
(128 in Linux 2.0 & 2.2), it is silently truncated
to 
.BR SOMAXCONN . 
Don't rely on this value in portable applications since BSD
(and some BSD-derived systems) limit the backlog to 5.

.BR connect (2),
