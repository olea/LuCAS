.TH SETEUID 2 2001-05-17 "Linux 2.4" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
seteuid, setegid \- set effective user or group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int seteuid(uid_t " euid );
.br
.BI "int setegid(gid_t " egid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B seteuid
sets the effective user ID of the current process.
Unprivileged user processes may only set the effective user ID to the
real user ID, the effective user ID or the saved user ID.

Precisely the same holds for
.B setegid
with "group" instead of "user".

.\" When
.\" .I euid
.\" equals \-1, nothing is changed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.\" .TP
.\" .B EINVAL
.TP
.B EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and
.I euid
(resp.
.IR egid )
is not the real user (group) ID, the effective user (group) ID
or the saved user (group) ID.
.SH NOTES
Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved user (group) ID is
possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).
On an arbitrary system one should check _POSIX_SAVED_IDS.
.LP
Under libc4, libc5 and glibc2.0
.BI seteuid( euid )
is equivalent to 
.BI setreuid(-1, " euid" )
and hence may change the saved user ID.
Under glibc2.1 it is equivalent to
.BI setresuid(-1, " euid" ,-1)
and hence does not change the saved user ID.
Similar remarks hold for
.BR setegid .
