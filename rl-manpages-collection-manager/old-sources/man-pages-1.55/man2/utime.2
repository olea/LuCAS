.TH UTIME 2 1995-06-10 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
utime, utimes \- change access and/or modification times of an inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <utime.h>
.sp
.BI "int utime(const char *" filename ", struct utimbuf *" buf );
.sp 2
.B #include <sys/time.h>
.sp
.BI "int utimes(char *" filename ", struct timeval *" tvp );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B utime
changes the access and modification times of the inode specified by
.I filename
to the
.IR actime " and " modtime
fields of 
.I buf
respectively.  If
.I buf
is
.BR NULL ,
then the access and modification times of the file are set to the current
time.  The
.I utimbuf
structure is:

.RS
.nf
struct utimbuf {
        time_t actime;  /* access time */
        time_t modtime; /* modification time */
};
.fi
.RE

In the Linux DLL 4.4.1 libraries,
.B utimes
is just a wrapper for
.BR utime :
.IR tvp [0]. tv_sec
is
.IR actime ,
and
.IR tvp [1]. tv_sec
is
.IR modtime .
The
.I timeval
structure is:

.RS
.nf
struct timeval {
        long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
        long    tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
};
.fi
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Other errors may occur.

.TP
.B EACCES
Permission to write the file is denied.
.TP
.B ENOENT
.I filename
does not exist.
