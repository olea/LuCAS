.TH GETHOSTID 2 1993-11-29 "Linux 0.99.13" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
gethostid, sethostid \- get or set the unique identifier of the current host
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.B long gethostid(void);
.br
.BI "int sethostid(long " hostid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Get or set a unique 32-bit identifier for the current machine.  The 32-bit
identifier is intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in
existence. This normally resembles the Internet address for the local
machine, as returned by
.BR gethostbyname (3),
and thus usually never needs to be set.

The
.B sethostid
call is restricted to the superuser.

The
.I hostid
argument is stored in the file
.IR /etc/hostid .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B gethostid
returns the 32-bit identifier for the current host as set by
.BR sethostid (2).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
4.2BSD.  These functions were dropped in 4.4BSD.
POSIX.1 does not define these functions, but ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 mentions
them in B.4.4.1.  SVr4 includes 
.B gethostid
but not
.BR sethostid .
.SH FILES
.I /etc/hostid
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR hostid (1),
.BR gethostbyname (3)
