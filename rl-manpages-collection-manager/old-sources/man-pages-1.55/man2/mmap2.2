.TH MMAP2 2 2002-01-31 "Linux 2.3.31" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mmap2 \- map files or devices into memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/mman.h>
.br
.B #include <syscall.h>
.sp
.BI "_syscall6(void *, " start ", size_t, " length ", int, " prot ,
.BI "int, " flags ", int, " fd ", off_t, " pgoffset );
.sp
.BI "void * mmap2(void *" start ", size_t " length ", int " prot ,
.BI "int " flags ", int " fd ", off_t " pgoffset );
.sp
.B #endif
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B mmap2
operates in exactly the same way as
.BR mmap (2),
except that the final argument specifies the offset into the
file in units of the system page size (instead of bytes).
This enables applications that use a 32-bit off_t to map
larger files (typically up to 2^44 bytes).
.SH NOTES
The function
.B mmap2
is available since Linux 2.3.31.
It is Linux specific, and should be avoided in portable applications.
See also the
.I mmap64()
function that is part of the LFS (Large File Summit).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR getpagesize (2),
.BR mmap (2),
.BR mremap (2),
.BR msync (2),
.BR shm_open (2)
