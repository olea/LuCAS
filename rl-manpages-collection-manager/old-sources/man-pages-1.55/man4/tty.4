.SH NAME
tty \- controlling terminal
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fB/dev/tty\fP is a character file with major number 5 and
minor number 0, usually of mode 0666 and owner.group root.tty.  It is a
synonym for the controlling terminal of a process, if any.
.LP
In addition to the \fBioctl()\fP requests supported by the device that
\fBtty\fP refers to, the following \fBioctl()\fP request is supported:
.IP \fBTIOCNOTTY\fP
Detach the current process from its controlling terminal, and remove it
from its current process group, without attaching it to a new process
group (that is, set its process group ID to zero).  This \fBioctl()\fP
call only works on file descriptors connected to \fB/dev/tty\fP; this is
used by daemon processes when they are invoked by a user at a terminal.
The process attempts to open \fB/dev/tty\fP; if the open succeeds, it
detaches itself from the terminal by using \fBTIOCNOTTY\fP, while if the
open fails, it is obviously not attached to a terminal and does not need
to detach itself.
