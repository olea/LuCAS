.TH GETSID 2 2001-12-17 "Linux 2.5.0" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getsid \- get session ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "pid_t getsid(pid_t" " pid" );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B getsid(0)
returns the session ID of the calling process.
.BI getsid( p )
returns the session ID of the process with process ID
.IR p .
(The session ID of a process is the process group ID of the
session leader.)
On error, (pid_t) \-1 will be returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
A process with process ID
.I p
exists, but it is not in the same session as the current process,
and the implementation considers this an error.
.TP
.B ESRCH
No process with process ID
.I p
was found.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, POSIX 1003.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
Linux does not return EPERM.
.LP
Linux has this system call since Linux 1.3.44.
There is libc support since libc 5.2.19.
.LP
To get the prototype under glibc, define both _XOPEN_SOURCE and
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, or use "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE \fIn\fP"
for some integer \fIn\fP larger than or equal to 500.
