.TH GETRUSAGE 2 2004-11-16 "Linux 2.6.9 "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getrusage \- get resource usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/time.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/resource.h>
.sp
.BI "int getrusage(int " who ", struct rusage *" usage );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getrusage ()
returns current resource usages, for a \fIwho\fP
of either 
.B RUSAGE_SELF
or 
.BR RUSAGE_CHILDREN .
The former asks for resources used by the current process,
the latter for resources used by those of its children
that have terminated and have been waited for.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I usage
points outside the accessible address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I who
is invalid.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, BSD 4.3
.SH NOTES
Including
.I <sys/time.h>
is not required these days, but increases portability.
(Indeed,
.I struct timeval
is defined in
.IR <sys/time.h> .)
.PP
In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.9, if the disposition of
.B SIGCHLD
is set to
.B SIG_IGN
then the resource usages of child processes
are automatically included in the value returned by
.BR RUSAGE_CHILDREN ,
although POSIX 1003.1-2001 explicitly prohibits this.
This non-conformance is rectified in Linux 2.6.9 and later.
.\" See the description of getrusage() in XSH.
.\" A similar statement was also in SUSv2.
.LP
The above struct was taken from BSD 4.3 Reno.
Not all fields are meaningful under Linux.
Right now (Linux 2.4, 2.6) only the fields
.BR ru_utime ,
.BR ru_stime ,
.BR ru_minflt ,
.BR ru_majflt ,
and
.BR ru_nswap
are maintained.
