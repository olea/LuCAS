.SH NAME
bcmp \- compare byte sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <strings.h>
.sp
.BI "int bcmp(const void *" s1 ", const void *" s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B bcmp()
function compares the two byte sequences
.I s1
and
.I s2
of length
.I n
each. If they are equal, and in particular if
.I n
is zero,
.B bcmp()
returns 0. Otherwise it returns a non-zero result.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.B bcmp()
function returns 0 if the byte sequences are equal,
otherwise a non-zero result is returned.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"

.BR memcmp
in new programs.
