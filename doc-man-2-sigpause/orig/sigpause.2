.TH SIGPAUSE 2 2004-05-10 "Linux 2.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigpause \- atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigpause(int " sigmask ");  /* BSD */"
.sp
.BI "int sigpause(int " sig ");      /* Unix95 */"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Don't use this function. Use
.BR sigsuspend (2)
instead.
.LP
The function
.B sigpause
is designed to wait for some signal.
It changes the process' signal mask (set of blocked signals),
and then waits for a signal to arrive.
Upon arrival of a signal, the original signal mask is restored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If
.B sigpause
returns, it was interrupted by a signal and the return value is \-1
with
.I errno
set to
.BR EINTR .
.SH HISTORY
The classical BSD version of this function appeared in 4.2BSD.
It sets the process' signal mask to
.IR sigmask .
When the number of signals was increased above 32, this version
was replaced by the incompatible Unix95 one, which removes only the
specified signal
.I sig
from the process' signal mask.
.\" __xpg_sigpause: Unix 95, spec 1170, SVID, SVR4, XPG
The unfortunate situation with two incompatible functions with the
same name was solved by the
.BR \%sigsuspend (2)
function, that takes a
.B "sigset_t *"
parameter (instead of an int).
.LP
On Linux, this routine is a system call only on the Sparc (sparc64)
architecture. Libc4 and libc5 only know about the BSD version.
Glibc uses the BSD version unless _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined.
.\" .SH NOTE
.\" For the BSD version, one usually uses a zero
.\" .I sigmask
.\" to indicate that no signals are to be blocked.
