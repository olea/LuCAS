.TH MAKECONTEXT 3 2001-11-15 "Linux 2.4" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
makecontext, swapcontext \- manipulate user context
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <ucontext.h>
.sp
.BI "void makecontext(ucontext_t *" ucp ", void *" func "(),
.BI "int " argc ", ...);"
.br
.BI "int swapcontext (ucontext_t *" oucp ", ucontext_t *" ucp );
.SH DESCRIPTION
In a SysV-like environment, one has the type \fBucontext_t\fP defined in
.I <ucontext.h>
and the four functions
\fBgetcontext()\fP, \fBsetcontext()\fP, \fBmakecontext()\fP
and \fBswapcontext()\fP that allow user-level context switching
between multiple threads of control within a process.
.LP
For the type and the first two functions, see
.BR getcontext (2).
.LP
The \fBmakecontext()\fP function modifies the context pointed to
by \fIucp\fP (which was obtained from a call to \fBgetcontext()\fP).
Before calling \fBmakecontext()\fP, one should allocate a new stack
for this context, assigning to \fIucp->uc_stack\fP, and define a
successor context, assigning to \fIucp->uc_link\fP.
When this context is later activated (using \fBsetcontext()\fP or
\fBswapcontext()\fP) then first the function \fIfunc\fP is called,
with the arguments specified following \fIargc\fP (where \fIargc\fP
must contain the number of these arguments), and when this function
returns, the successor context is activated. When the successor context
pointer is NULL, the thread exits.
.LP
The \fBswapcontext()\fP function saves the current context in
the structure pointed to by \fIoucp\fP, and then activates the
context pointed to by \fIucp\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
When successful, \fBmakecontext()\fP returns 0 and \fBswapcontext()\fP
does not return. (But we may return later, in case \fIoucp\fP is
activated, in which case it looks like \fBswapcontext()\fP returns 0.)
On error, both return \-1 and set \fIerrno\fP appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient stack space left.
.SH NOTES
The interpretation of \fIucp->uc_stack\fP is just as in
.BR sigaltstack (2),
namely, this struct contains start and length of a memory area
to be used as stack, regardless of the direction of growth of
the stack. So, it is not necessary for the user program to
worry about this direction.
