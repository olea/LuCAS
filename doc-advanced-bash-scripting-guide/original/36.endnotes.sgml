      <title>Author's Note</title>


      <para>How did I come to write a Bash scripting book? It's a strange
        tale. It seems that a couple of years back, I needed to learn
        shell scripting, and what better way to do that than to read
        a good book on the subject.  I was looking to buy a tutorial
        and reference covering all aspects of scripting.  In fact,
        I was looking for this very book, or something much like
        it. Unfortunately, it didn't exist, so if I wanted it, I had to
        write it.  And so, here we are, folks.</para>

      <para>This reminds me of the apocryphal story about the mad
        professor. Crazy as a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a
        book, any book, at the library, at a bookstore, anywhere, he
        would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have
        written it, should have written it, and done a better job of it to
        boot. He would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that,
        write a book with the same title. When he died some years later,
        he allegedly had several thousand books to his credit, probably
        putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have been any
        good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow
        who lived his dream, even if he was driven by it, and I can't
        help admiring the old coot...</para>
