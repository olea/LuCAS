      <para>A Bash <emphasis>alias</emphasis> is essentially nothing more than
	a keyboard shortcut, an abbreviation, a means of avoiding
	typing a long command sequence. If, for example, we include
	<command>alias lm="ls -l | more"</command> in the <link
	linkend="filesref"><filename>~/.bashrc</filename> file</link>,
	then each <userinput>lm</userinput> typed at the command
	line will automatically be replaced by a <command>ls -l |
	more</command>. This can save a great deal of typing at the
	command line and avoid having to remember complex combinations of
	commands and options. Setting <command>alias rm="rm -i"</command>
	(interactive mode delete) may save a good deal of grief, since
	it can prevent inadvertently losing important files.</para>

      <para>In a script, aliases have very limited usefulness. It would be
	quite nice if aliases could assume some of the functionality of
	the C preprocessor, such as macro expansion, but unfortunately
	Bash does not expand arguments within the alias body.
	  <footnote><para>However, aliases do seem to expand positional
	  parameters.</para></footnote>
	Moreover, a script fails to expand an alias itself
	within <quote>compound constructs</quote>, such as <link
	linkend="ifthen">if/then</link> statements, loops, and
	functions. An added limitation is that an alias will not expand
	recursively. Almost invariably, whatever we would like an alias
	to do could be accomplished much more effectively with a <link
	linkend="functionref">function</link>.</para>
