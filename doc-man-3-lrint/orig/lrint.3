.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions round their argument to the nearest integer value,
using the current rounding direction.
If \fIx\fP is infinite or NaN, or if the rounded value is outside
the range of the return type, the numeric result is unspecified.
A domain error may occur if the magnitude of \fIx\fP is too large.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The rounded integer value.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
The magnitude of \fIx\fP is too large and
.I "(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)"
is non-zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99.
