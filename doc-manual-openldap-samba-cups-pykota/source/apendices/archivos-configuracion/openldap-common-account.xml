# /etc/pam.d/common-account - authorization settings common to all services
#
# This module performs non-authentication based account management. It is
# typically used to restrict/permit access to a service based on the time of day,
# currently available system resources (maximum number of users) or perhaps
# the location of the applicant user---`root' login only on the console.
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authorization modules that define
# the central access policy for use on the system.  The default is to
# only deny service to users whose accounts are expired in /etc/shadow.
