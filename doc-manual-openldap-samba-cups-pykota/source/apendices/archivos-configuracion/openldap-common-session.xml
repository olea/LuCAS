# /etc/pam.d/common-session - session-related modules common to all services
#
# This module is associated with doing things that need to be done for the
# user before/after they can be given service. Such things include the
# logging of information concerning the opening/closing of some data exchange
# with a user, mounting directories, etc. .
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define tasks to be performed
# at the start and end of sessions of *any* kind (both interactive and
# non-interactive).  The default is pam_unix.
