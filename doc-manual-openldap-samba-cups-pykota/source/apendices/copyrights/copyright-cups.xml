	<title>INTRODUCTION</title>


	<para>
	<trademark>The Common UNIX Printing System</trademark>,
	("<trademark>CUPS</trademark>"), is provided
	under the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License
	("<acronym>GPL</acronym> ") and <acronym>GNU</acronym>  Library
	General Public License ("<acronym>LGPL</acronym> "),
	Version 2, with exceptions for
	Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A copy of the
	exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	The <acronym>GNU</acronym> <acronym>LGPL</acronym>
	applies to the <acronym>CUPS</acronym> <acronym>API</acronym> 
	library, located in the "<filename class="directory">cups</filename>"
	 subdirectory of the <acronym>CUPS</acronym> source distribution and in the
	"<filename class="directory">cups</filename>"
	include directory and library files in the binary
	distributions. The GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the
	<acronym>CUPS</acronym> 
	distribution, including the "pdftops" filter which is based upon
	Xpdf and the <acronym>CUPS</acronym> imaging library.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
	allows you to:
	</para>
	
	<itemizedlist mark="fillcircle">
		<listitem>
			<para>Use the CUPS software at no charge.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
			binary form.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
			sell support for the software.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Distribute or sell printer drivers and filters that use
			CUPS so long as source code is made available under the
			GPL.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	
	<para>
	What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
	add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
	source code. You must provide source for any new drivers,
	changes, or additions to the software, and all code must be
	provided under the GPL or LGPL as appropriate. The only
	exceptions to this are the portions of the CUPS software covered
	by the Apple operating system license exceptions outlined later
	in this license agreement.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
	develop applications that use the CUPS API library under other
	licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your application.
	</para>

	<title>LICENSE EXCEPTIONS</title>
