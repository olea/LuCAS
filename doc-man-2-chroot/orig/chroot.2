.TH CHROOT 2 2004-06-23 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
chroot \- change root directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int chroot(const char *" path );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chroot
changes the root directory to that specified in
.IR path .
This directory will be used for path names beginning with /.  The root
directory is inherited by all children of the current process.

Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the
.B CAP_SYS_CHROOT
capability) may call
.BR chroot (2).

This call changes an ingredient in the pathname resolution process
and does nothing else.

This call does not change the current working directory,
so that after the call `.' can be outside the tree rooted at `/'.
In particular, the superuser can escape from a `chroot jail'
by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.

This call does not close open file descriptors, and such file
descriptors may allow access to files outside the chroot tree.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Depending on the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
general errors are listed below:
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (2).)
.\" Also search permission is required on the final component,
.\" maybe just to guarantee that it is a directory?
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I path
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.B EPERM
The caller has insufficient privilege.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, 4.4BSD, X/OPEN.  This function is not part of POSIX.1.
SVr4 documents additional EINTR, ENOLINK and EMULTIHOP error conditions.
X/OPEN does not document EIO, ENOMEM or EFAULT error conditions.
This interface is marked as legacy by X/OPEN.
.SH NOTES
FreeBSD has a stronger
.I jail()
system call.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR chdir (2),
.BR path_resolution (2)
