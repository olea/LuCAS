.SH NAME
atoi, atol, atoll, atoq \- convert a string to an integer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "int atoi(const char *" nptr );
.br
.BI "long atol(const char *" nptr );
.br
.BI "long long atoll(const char *" nptr );
.br
.BI "long long atoq(const char *" nptr );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBatoi()\fP function converts the initial portion of the string
pointed to by \fInptr\fP to
.IR int .
The behaviour is the same as
.sp
.RS
.B strtol(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10);
.RE
.sp
except that \fBatoi()\fP does not detect errors.
.PP
The \fBatol()\fP and \fBatoll()\fP functions behave the same as
\fBatoi()\fR, except that they convert the initial portion of the
string to their return type of \fIlong\fP or \fIlong long\fP.
\fBatoq()\fP is an obsolete name for \fBatoll()\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The converted value.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX.1, BSD 4.3, ISO/IEC 9899.  ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (C89) and
POSIX.1 (1996 edition) include the functions \fBatoi()\fP and
\fBatol()\fP only; C99 adds the function \fBatoll()\fP.
.SH NOTES
The non-standard \fBatoq()\fP function is not present in libc 4.6.27
or glibc 2, but is present in libc5 and libc 4.7 (though only as an
inline function in \fB<stdlib.h>\fP until libc 5.4.44).  The
\fBatoll()\fP function is present in glibc 2 since version 2.0.2, but
not in libc4 or libc5.
