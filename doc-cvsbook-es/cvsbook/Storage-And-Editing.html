<h3>Storage And Editing</h3>

<p>Generally, the administrative files are kept under revision control just
like any other file in the repository (the exceptions are noted). 
However, unlike other files, checked-out copies of the administrative
files are stored in the repository, right next to their corresponding
RCS files in the <code>CVSROOT</code> subdirectory.  It is these checked-out
copies which actually govern CVS's behavior.

<p>The normal way to modify the administrative files is to check out a
working copy of the CVSROOT module, make your changes, and commit.  CVS
updates the checked-out copies in the repository automatically.  (See
<a href="checkoutlist.html">checkoutlist</a>.)  In an emergency, however, it is also possible to
edit the checked-out copies in the repository directly.
