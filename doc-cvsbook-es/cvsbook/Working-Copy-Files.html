<h2>Working Copy Files</h2>

<p>The CVS/ administrative subdirectories in each working copy contain some
subset of the following files.

<ul>
<li>CVS/Base/
<li>CVS/Baserev
<li>CVS/Baserev.tmp
<li>CVS/Checkin.prog
<li>CVS/Entries
<li>CVS/Entries.Backup
<li>CVS/Entries.Log
<li>CVS/Entries.Static
<li>CVS/Notify
<li>CVS/Notify.tmp
<li>CVS/Repository
<li>CVS/Root
<li>CVS/Tag
<li>CVS/Template
<li>CVS/Update.prog
</ul>

<p>Here is what each file or directory does:

<h3><code>CVS/Base/</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;(directory)</h3>

<p>If watches are on, <code>cvs&nbsp;edit</code> stores the original copy of the
file in this directory.  That way, <code>cvs&nbsp;unedit</code> can work even
if it can't reach the server.

<h3><code>CVS/Baserev</code></h3>

<p>Lists the revision for each file in <code>Base/</code>.  Each line looks like
this:

<pre>FILE/REVISION/EXPANSION
</pre>

<p>EXPANSION is currently ignored to allow for, well, future expansion.

<h3><code>CVS/Baserev.tmp</code></h3>

<p>This is the temp file for the preceding.  (See <code>CVS/Notify.tmp</code> or
<code>CVS/Entries.Backup</code> later on for further explanation.)

<h3><code>CVS/Checkin.prog</code></h3>

<p>Records the name of the program specified by the -i option in the
modules file.  (See the <a href="Ficheros-de-Administracion-del-Repositorio.html">Ficheros de Administracion del Repositorio</a> section
in this chapter.)

<h3><code>CVS/Entries</code></h3>

<p>Stores the revisions for the files in this directory.  Each line is of
the form:

<pre>[CODE_LETTER]/FILE/REVISION/DATE/[KEYWORD_MODE]/[STICKY_OPTION]
</pre>

<p>If CODE_LETTER is present, it must be <code>D</code> for directory (anything
else is silently ignored by CVS, to allow for future expansion), and the
rest of the items on the line are absent.

<p>This file is always present.

<h3><code>CVS/Entries.Backup</code></h3>

<p>This is just a temp file.  If you're writing some program to modify the
<code>Entries</code> file, have it write the new contents to
<code>Entries.backup</code> and then atomically rename it to <code>Entries</code>.

<h3><code>CVS/Entries.Log</code></h3>

<p>This is basically a patch file to be applied to <code>Entries</code> after
<code>Entries</code> has been read (this is an efficiency hack, to avoid
having to rewrite all of <code>Entries</code> for every little change).  The
format is the same as <code>Entries</code>, except that there is an additional
mandatory code letter at the front of every line: An <code>A</code> means this
line is to be added to what's in <code>Entries</code>; <code>R</code> means it's to
be removed from what's in <code>Entries</code>.  Any other letters should be
silently ignored, to allow for future expansion.

<h3><code>CVS/Entries.Static</code></h3>

<p>If this file exists, it means only part of the directory was fetched
from the repository, and CVS will not create additional files in that
directory.  This condition can usually be cleared by using
<code>update&nbsp;-d</code>.

<h3><code>CVS/Notify</code></h3>

<p>Stores notifications that have not yet been sent to the server.

<h3><code>CVS/Notify.tmp</code></h3>

<p>Temp file for <code>Notify</code>.  The usual procedure for modifying
<code>Notify</code> is to write out <code>Notify.tmp</code> and then rename it to
<code>Notify</code>.

<h3><code>CVS/Repository</code></h3>

<p>The path to the project-specific subdirectory in the repository.  This
may be an absolute path, or it may be relative to the path given in
Root.

<p>This file is always present.

<h3><code>CVS/Root</code></h3>

<p>This is the repository; that is, the value of the <code>$CVSROOT</code>
environment variable or the argument to the -d global option.

<p>This file is always present.

<h3><code>CVS/Tag</code></h3>

<p>If there is a sticky tag or date on this directory, it is recorded in
the first line of the file.  The first character is a single letter
indicating the type of tag: <code>T</code>, <code>N</code>, or <code>D</code>, for branch
tag, nonbranch tag, or date respectively.  The rest of the line is the
tag or date itself.

<h3><code>CVS/Template</code></h3>

<p>Contains a log message template as specified by the rcsinfo file.  (See
<a href="Ficheros-de-Administracion-del-Repositorio.html">Ficheros de Administracion del Repositorio</a> earlier in this chapter.)  It
is relevant only for remote working copies; working copies on the same
machine as the repository just read rcsinfo directly.

<h3><code>CVS/Update.prog</code></h3>

<p>Records the name of the program specified by the -u option in the
modules file.  (See the <a href="Ficheros-de-Administracion-del-Repositorio.html">Ficheros de Administracion del Repositorio</a> section
in this chapter.)
