<h3>Shared Syntax</h3>

<p>In all of the administrative files, a <code>#</code> at the beginning of a line
signifies a comment; that line is ignored by CVS.  A backslash preceding
a newline quotes the newline out of existence.

<p>Some of the files (commitinfo, loginfo, taginfo, and rcsinfo) share more
syntactic conventions as well.  In these files, on the left of each line
is a regular expression (which is matched against a file or directory
name), and the rest of the line is a program, possibly with arguments,
which is invoked if something is done to a file matching the regular
expression.  The program is run with its working directory set to the
top of the repository.

<p>In these files, there are two special regular expressions that may be
used: ALL and DEFAULT.  ALL matches any file or directory, whether or
not there is some other match for it, and DEFAULT matches only if
nothing else matched.
