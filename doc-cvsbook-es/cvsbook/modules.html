<h3>modules</h3>

<p>This maps names to repository directories.  The general syntax of each
line is:

<pre>MODULE&nbsp;[OPTIONS]&nbsp;[&amp;OTHERMODULE...]&nbsp;[DIR]&nbsp;[FILES]
</pre>

<p>DIR need not be a top-level project directory - it could be a
subdirectory.  If any FILES are specified, the module consists of only
those files from the directory.

<p>An ampersand followed by a module name means to include the expansion of
that module's line in place.

<p>Options:

<ul>

<li>-a - This is an <dfn>alias</dfn> module, meaning it expands literally to
everything after the OPTIONS.  In this case, the usual DIR/FILES
behavior is turned off, and everything after the OPTIONS is treated as
other modules or repository directories.

<p>If you use the -a option, you may exclude certain directories from other
modules by putting them after an exclamation point (!).  For example

<pre>top_proj -a !myproj/a-subdir !myproj/b-subdir myproj
</pre>

<p>means that checking out <code>top_proj</code> will get all of <code>myproj</code>
except <code>a-subdir</code> and <code>b-subdir</code>.

</p><li>-d NAME - Names the working directory NAME instead of the module name.

<li>-e PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are exported.

<li>-i PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are committed. 
The program is given a single argument - the full pathname in the
repository of the file in question. (See <a href="commitinfo.html">commitinfo</a>,
<a href="loginfo.html">loginfo</a>, and <a href="verifymsg.html">verifymsg</a> for more sophisticated ways to
run commit-triggered programs.)

<li>-o PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are checked
out.  The program is given a single argument, the name of the module.

<li>-s STATUS - Declares a status for the module.  When the modules file is
printed (with cvs checkout -s), the modules are sorted by module status
and then by name.  This option has no other effects in CVS, so go wild. 
You can use it to sort anything - status, person responsible for the
module, or the module's file language, for example.

<li>-t PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are tagged with
cvs rtag.  The program is passed two arguments: the name of the module
and the tag name.  The program is not used for tag, only for rtag.  I
have no idea why this distinction is made.  You may find the taginfo
file more useful if you want to run programs at tag time.

<li>-u PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever a working copy of the module is
updated from its top-level directory.  The program is given a single
argument, the full path to the module's repository.

</ul>
