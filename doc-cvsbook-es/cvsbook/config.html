<h3>config</h3>

<p>Controls various global (non-project-specific) repository parameters. 
The syntax of each line is

<pre>ParameterName=yes|no
</pre>

<p>except for the LockDir parameter, which takes an absolute pathname as
argument.

<p>The following parameters are supported:

<ul>

<li>RCSBIN (default: <code>=no</code>) - (Obsolete) This option is silently
accepted for backwards compatibility, but no longer has any effect.

<li>SystemAuth (default: <code>=no</code>) - If <code>yes</code>, CVS pserver
authentication tries the system user database - usually
<code>/etc/passwd</code> - if a username is not found in
<code>CVSROOT/passwd</code>.  If <code>no</code>, the user must exist in
<code>CVSROOT/passwd</code> to gain access via the <code>:pserver:</code> method.

<li>PreservePermissions (default: <code>=no</code>) - If <code>yes</code>, CVS tries to
preserve permissions and other special file system information (such as
device numbers and symbolic link targets) for files.  You probably don't
want to do this, as it does not necessarily behave as expected. (See the
node <cite>Special Files</cite> in the Cederqvist manual for details.)

<li>TopLevelAdmin (default: <code>=no</code>) - If <code>yes</code>, checkouts create a
<code>CVS/</code> subdirectory next to each working copy tree (in the parent
directory of the working copy).  This can be useful if you will be
checking out many working copies from the same repository; on the other
hand, setting it here affects everyone who uses this repository.

<li>LockDir (unset by default) - The argument after the equal sign is a
path to a directory in which CVS can create lockfiles.  If not set,
lockfiles are created in the repository, in locations corresponding to
each project's RCS files.  This means that users of those projects must
have file-system-level write access to those repository directories.

</ul>
