<h3>commitinfo</h3>

<p>Specifies programs to run at commit time, based on what's being
committed.  Each line consists of a regular expression followed by a
command template:

<pre>REGULAR_EXPRESSION PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]
</pre>

<p>The PROGRAM is passed additional arguments following any arguments you
may have written into the template.  These additional arguments are the
full path to the repository, followed by the name of each file about to
be committed.  These files can be examined by PROGRAM; their contents
are the same as those of the working copy files about to be committed. 
If PROGRAM exits with nonzero status, the commit fails; otherwise, it
succeeds.  (See also <a href="Shared-Syntax.html">Shared Syntax</a> earlier in this chapter.)
